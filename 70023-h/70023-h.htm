<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>The Reigning Belle</span>,” by Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, is a romantic and thrilling novel of
fashionable society, full of intensely dramatic scenes and overflowing with absorbing interest.
The action goes straight ahead. So skilfully is the plot framed and handled that the veil of
mystery surrounding Eva Laurence, the beautiful shop-girl, Mrs. Lambert, the society belle,
and Herman Ross, the artist, cannot be penetrated until the author sees fit to throw it aside.
Eva is a charming heroine, and the hero, Ivon Lambert, is a fine specimen of American manhood.
The love episodes are delightfully depicted. There is much enjoyable humor in the novel, relieving
the numerous exciting incidents. The scene in the Lambert conservatory between Mrs. Lambert
and Ross, Mrs. Lambert’s jealous espionage of Ross at Mrs. Carter’s party, the episode in
the court-room and the exposure of Miss Spicer are particularly stirring, but the whole romance
is unusually powerful and effective. Everybody should read “<span class='sc'>The Reigning Belle</span>” and enjoy
a rich treat. Mrs. Stephens’ novels are among the best and most popular published, are admired
by young and old alike, should be read by all, and will be found for sale by all Booksellers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“<span class='sc'>The Reigning Belle</span>” is one of the most powerful,
original and exciting society novels ever published.
Though Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, its famous and gifted
author, has written many superb romances, she has
surpassed herself in this. The scene is laid in New
York, and fashionable society is liberally drawn upon,
while lowly life also comes in for its share of treatment.
The plot is thrilling, intricate and managed with consummate
art, the reader being kept in complete ignorance
of what the end is to be until it comes. In the
web of impenetrable mystery a lost child, Eva Laurence,
Herman Ross and Mrs. Lambert are involved,
and upon them and their hidden relation to each other
the thrilling romance hinges. Eva is a handsome
shop-girl, who is adopted by the wife of a shoddy millionaire,
Ross an artist with a past full of shadows, and
Mrs. Lambert a society belle. Humor is furnished in
abundance and stirring episodes come thick and fast.
Eva has a devoted admirer in Ivon Lambert, and the
love scenes between the pair are natural and delicious.
“<span class='sc'>The Reigning Belle</span>” is certain to find hosts of
readers, and it possesses every requisite to delight and
fascinate them all. Mrs. Stephens, as a writer, ranks
among the best of all American authors, and her novels
should be read by every lover of absorbing fiction, for
they are among the best and most popular published,
and will be found for sale by all Booksellers everywhere,
or copies of any or all of them will be sent to
any one, to any place, post-paid, on receipt of price by
the publishers.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>THE SHOPPING PARTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Around her were such glowing colors, in masses, or
floating airily through the room, that a face less richly
tinted would have seemed pale by contrast. Behind her
was a pile of India shawls, in which the rays of a gorgeous
sunset seemed to have mellowed down in one soft, glowing
heap. By her side was a morning-dress of Oriental cashmere,
with vivid palm leaves running far up the skirt, which
trailed down from the wire skeleton that supported it, and
swept the floor like the plumage of a peacock.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fact this vast show-room was one panorama of bright,
beautiful things; and most beautiful of all was the young
girl, with her rich complexion, just verging on the brunette,
and her large, blue-gray eyes, that looked out from
their sweeping lashes like shadowed waters where the rushes
grow thickly. Her hair, too, was lustrous and abundant,
neither black, auburn, nor brown, but with a gleam of each
as the light chanced to fall on it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The face, we have so imperfectly described, was turned
toward a flight of stairs that led from the more general
warerooms below, and across it flew a shadow of pride or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>pain, as a party of ladies, accompanied by one gentleman,
came up the stairs, and loitered along the show-room, where
she was standing. One of the clerks went forward to meet
the party, and turning, walked by the side of the younger
lady, who came on somewhat in advance of the rest, politely
attentive to business.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shawls, did you say?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered the young lady, smiling blandly in the
face of the clerk, whose soft amber beard stirred almost
imperceptibly with an answering smile. “I scarcely know
yet what we do want; but my friend has a perfect passion for
shawls, and I dare say will add another to the variety she
has stored away in her cedar-closet, where even the moths
are forbidden to touch them. Oh Mrs. Lambert! here is
something lovely!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The elder lady came forward, and, taking out her gold-mounted
eye-glass, examined the shawl which had struck
the young lady’s attention. It was, indeed, a fabric of
wonderful beauty, soft, firm, and wrought in with a splendor
of harmonious colors, which the most perfect taste alone
could appreciate. But the lady who examined this exquisite
workmanship well understood its value, and after making
herself mistress of all its perfections, quietly inquired the
price.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sum named would have bought a pretty homestead for
some poor family in the country. The lady seemed in no
way surprised by the amount, but took the shawl from its
stand, while the young lady beckoned the girl, who had
withdrawn a little way off, to try it on.</p>

<p class='c006'>This young creature came forward, not blushing under
the astonished eyes turned upon her, but rather growing
pale, with a keen feeling of humiliation, and submitted her
queenly person to be enveloped in the rich folds of the shawl.
When she felt all those strange eyes upon her the color came
back to her face, while the downcast lashes swept her glowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>cheeks, and her lips began to quiver, as if a burst of
tears were struggling upward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother,” said the young gentleman, in a low voice,
“the counter would be a better place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no!” broke in the very positive young person,
whom the elder lady addressed as Miss Spicer, who leaned
forward and touched the shoulder over which the shawl was
draped with her parasol. “Nothing like a live person to
carry off a thing like this. Please move forward and let us
see how it falls upon the train. Superb, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva Laurence lifted her eyelids with a sudden flash, and
stepped back from the insolent touch of that parasol, with a
gesture at once haughty and graceful. Then, remembering
what was expected of her, she moved across the floor, displaying
the shawl in every fold as it swept from her shoulders,
down the long, black train of her dress. All other eyes
were fixed upon the garment, but young Lambert saw that
her bosom heaved, and the hands folded over the shawl
trembled. He was turning away, touched by this evidence
of painful embarrassment, when Miss Spicer darted forward,
seized upon Eva’s train, and spread it out upon the floor,
exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c006'>“There now, that’s something like. Isn’t it superb?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is, indeed!” answered Mrs. Lambert, surveying the
tall, well-formed girl with her glass. “What do you think,
of it Ivon?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do I think, mother? Why, that the young lady
will be tired to death before you have made up your mind.
Permit me——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here young Lambert lifted the shawl gently from Eva’s
shoulders, and laid it on the counter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva drew a deep breath and moved off to a window,
resentful and hurt, she could scarcely tell why—for had she
not come to that place for the very purpose that wounded
her so? Did she not receive extra compensation because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her stately figure carried off those costly garments to such
advantage? What right had she that this patrician party
had invaded?</p>

<p class='c006'>Still the girl’s cheek burned, and her shoulders felt heavy,
as if a burden more oppressive than twenty shawls bore
them down.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>THE GIRL OF THE TIMES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>While Mrs. Lambert was completing the purchase of
her shawl, the young man moved quietly about the room,
carrying his cane in one well-gloved hand, with which he
manifested a little impatience, as most men do when forced
into a shopping excursion with members of their own
family; but, with all his restlessness, he kept Eva Laurence
well in view, wondering in his heart who she was, and how
she came to be in that strange position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer, too, had her curiosity. Troubled with no
sensitive hesitation, she watched the girl in a bold, staring
way, now and then turning a quizzical look on young Lambert,
which brought the color to his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stylish, ha!” she whispered, taking the young man’s
cane from his hand. “Stop here often after this, I dare say—I
would if I carried one of these things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young lady gave emphasis to her words by a dashing
flourish of the cane, which, being a flexible, gold-mounted
affair, she was twisting back and forth in her hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young gentleman made a gesture as if to reclaim his
property.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer gave up the cane.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva Laurence saw all this, though her drooping eyes
seemed fixed on the floor, and the proud heart burned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in her; for now and then Miss Spicer glanced across the
piles of merchandise to where she stood, taking no pains to
conceal that she was an object of curiosity, if not of conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There now, don’t look so savage, my friend,” said the
lady, “and you shall see what a chance I will give you for
a second survey.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before young Lambert could answer, the reckless creature
had called another clerk to her side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This velvet cloak,” she said, “I should like to see it
tried on. Please call the young person.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The clerk stepped over to Eva Laurence, and spoke to
her. She looked up quickly, bent her head, and came across
the room, almost smiling the contempt she felt for that rude
girl, who only seemed the more plebeian from the fact that
her coarseness was smothered in purple and fine linen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Without a word Eva invested herself in the velvet garment,
and with its rich, deep laces settling round her, stood
out in the midst of the open space to be examined, looking
gravely and quietly on the group that gathered around
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the ladies fell to examining the cloak by detail;
handling its glossy folds, criticising the pattern of the lace,
and exclaiming at the perfect fit; while Spicer turned the
shrinking girl round, and jerked the cloak in and out of
place, as if that proud, sensitive creature were a mere lay-figure,
with a wooden soul, created for her amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There now, Mr. Lambert, tell me if this is not perfect?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer turned as she spoke; but the gentleman, for
whom all this display had been gotten up, was at the other
end of the room, looking diligently out of the window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Lambert! Mr. Lambert! Come; we want your
opinion,” cried Miss Spicer, so loudly that every one in the
room could hear.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“I beg your pardon,” answered the young man, blushing
with angry annoyance; “gentlemen are no judges of such
things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer walked toward him, grasping her parasol as
if it had been a spear, with which she meant to pierce him
through.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, this is too bad, after all the pains I have taken!
Come along, I say.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lambert turned from the window and followed his tormentor.
He did not even glance at Eva Laurence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother, I have an engagement; pray, excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“An engagement—gone! The idea!”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this exclamation, Miss Spicer turned from the girl
she had tortured, and the cloak she did not want, with a
gesture of the hand, meant to indicate that she had done
with the whole affair, and became all at once impatient to
leave the establishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert, who had concluded her purchase, and had
been standing an amused spectator of her friend’s defeat,
was now ready to go; and Eva saw them depart with a
feeling of resentful humiliation, which brought a hot red to
her cheeks, and mingled fire and tears to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You find it hard,” said a voice at her elbow. “We all
rebel at first; but time and patience do wonders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The person who spoke was a slight, dark-eyed man, about
thirty-five or forty years of age, whose low, kind voice fell
gently on her disturbed senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it is hard,” answered Eva; and the tears that had
been gathering in her eyes flashed over the vivid red of her
cheeks, and melted there like dew upon a peach. “I did
not expect this—I thought that ladies alone would claim my
services.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You forget,” said her fellow clerk, “that money does not
always fall to the wise or the refined.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“But a person like that, coarse, unfeeling, and insolent—what
right has she to money, while I have nothing?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! there is the old story, restless rebellion against
things as they are and must be. The law gives her a
fortune which some one else has earned—it is the chance of
her birth; but nature withheld from her many things far
more precious than wealth, which she has lavished on—on
others, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva blushed, and a smile quivered over her lips. This
half-suppressed compliment soothed her wounded pride a
little, but she soon broke into impatience again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is there no way in which a poor girl can support herself
without meeting these bitter insults?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do intelligence, refinement, noble aspirations, go for
nothing when joined with honest labor?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, child, as they enchance the value of that labor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And labor is slavery,” murmured the girl, looking
toward the broad window, against which the sunshine was
breaking in bright waves of silver. “That girl is her own
mistress—can go where she will—say what she pleases—wound
others if she likes, without rebuke or compunction.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you call <i>that</i> a privilege?” questioned the man,
who listened with a grave smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no! I could not do it. Knowing how keenly a
poor girl can feel, no amount of prosperity could induce me
to wound one as—as that girl has hurt me. If I were
rich—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if you were rich? What then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would think of others, use my wealth to make others
prosperous. No girl with a soul should be shut up in a great
room like this, to show off garments for happier woman to
wear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet it is only a little time since you were so glad to
come here.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Eva’s face changed and the cloud was swept from it as if
by a flash of lightning. She reached forth her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think me impatient, and so I am; ungrateful—but
that I am not. I was glad to come here—<i>so</i> glad! The
sweetest hour of my life will be that in which I carry home
my first week’s wages, and see those poor, dear faces brighten
with a sight of the money. How can I be so unreasonable?
Forgive me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>A HUMBLE HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Up town, where vacant lots can still be found, stood a
small wooden building, scarcely more than a shantie in dimensions,
but perfectly finished, so far as it went, and neat
in all its appointments as any palace. Two small rooms on
the first floor, and a like number of sleeping chambers, with
their ceilings in the roof, took up the entire length and
breadth of the building. The little space of ground, not
occupied by the building, was given up to turf and brightened
with flowers, which climbed the fences and ran up the
little portico, as leaves cluster around a bird’s-nest in the
spring. Indeed, that little spot of earth was lovely. In the
cool of the day, thousands of purple and pink morning glories
shook the dew from their delicate bells, and, at all hours
masses of scarlet beans, cypress-vines, and sweet scented
clematis, kept the little enclosure bright and beautiful,
week in and week out, so long as the season lasted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The house itself contained little of value. Curtains of
cheap muslin, white as snow, through which you could see a
thousand delicate shadows from the flowers outside, shaded
the windows.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>In the front room was a pretty chintz couch, home-made,
with dainty cushions, and an easy-chair to match, the workmanship
of some strong, deft hand in the first construction,
and finished up by the taste, still more perfect, of a woman,
to whom the aesthetic influence was second nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two or three really fine engravings were on the walls, and
in one corner stood a straight-legged, old piano, with an embroidered
stool.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two persons sat in this room, at nightfall, on the day
Eva Laurence made her little outburst of pride in that fashionable
establishment down town. One was a tall, spare
woman, about fifty years of age, perhaps, originally from
New England, as you might detect from a certain peculiarity
of speech, and the constant occupation she found for her
hands, even while seated in that roomy easy-chair. The
other was a young girl, seemingly about fourteen at a first
glance; but on a second look, you saw traces of thought
and of pain on that noble face, which took your judgment
in a few years. The girl was near the age of her sister
Eva; in fact, there was not a year between them, and if
that had been all, they might have passed for twins. But
there the resemblance ended. Nothing could be more unlike
the rich coloring and perfect figure of Eva than the
pale delicacy and wonderful expression of this girl on the
couch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>How sweet and low that voice was! This one incomparable
word seemed rippling off into music, full of tenderness
and gentle pathos.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Ruth, what is it? Shall I move the cushions?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, mother; but you seem thoughtful. Has anything
gone wrong that I do not know of?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wrong? No! It is only the one old trouble!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The house?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Yes. I am afraid, Ruth, that we shall have to give it
up. The mortgage will be due this year——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Eva thought——”</p>

<p class='c006'> “Yes, dear, I know. If she had only got her situation a
little earlier, there might have been some chance; but the
lot is growing more valuable all the time, and Mr. Clapp is
a grasping man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth Laurence clasped her hands, and turned her eyes
upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! how helpless I am!” she said, with a thrill of
pathetic pain in her voice. “If we could both work now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that is impossible. Besides, what would the house
be without you—a cage without its bird?”</p>

<p class='c006'>That moment, a brave, young voice came singing up to
the front door of that tiny house, and a bright face leaned
through the open window, under which Ruth was lying, and
shook some ripe leaves from the vines upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right—both here,” cried as fine a school-boy as you
ever sat eyes on, swinging a package of books down from
his shoulder, and coming through the little hall. “I’ve got
along famously, mother: not a demerit. But what makes
you look so sober?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The lad seemed to lose something of his bright animation
as he entered that humble parlor and saw his mother’s
anxious face, his large grey eyes clouded over with anxiety
and he stood a moment gazing mutely upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, mother,” he said at last, “has Eva come home
yet? She promised us a famous supper when those people
paid her, and I’m on hand for it, if ever a little chap was.
Not here yet, you say! Now that’s what I call rough!
Isn’t it, sister Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She will be home soon,” answered sister Ruth, returning
the boy’s kiss with a gentle sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How cold your lips are!” exclaimed the boy, and a look
of tender trouble came into his eyes. “Is it because you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>are hungry, sister Ruth? If it is, I’ll—I’ll go and sell my
school-books, and play hookey after it, to get you something
to eat. As for me, I was only in fun. A chap of my age
don’t want much, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the books are not yours, dear,” answered the sweet,
sad voice from the couch; “they belong to the city.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy stood still a moment while the slow color mounted
to his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that,” he answered, almost crying; “but just
then they seemed to be mine, dear old friends, ready to go
anywhere for my good. Anyway, if I was a fairy now,
every one of them should turn into something good to eat;
bread for me, and pound-cake for mother, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beef-steak for us all!” said the mother, joining in the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy drew in his breath and smacked his lips, as if the
very idea of a warm beef-steak were a delicious morsel to be
tasted and lingered over.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that! but then one must not be extravagant. Who
knows! Eva may come back with a whole pocket full of
rocks!” the boy broke forth, after a moment of dull
despondency. “Come, mother, cheer up, something good is
going to happen. I feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence arose feebly from her chair, took the boy’s
head between her hands and kissed him, with a sort of slow
restrained passion, half a dozen times, as if she thought
each kiss could be coined into food for his hungry lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you so very——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a bit of it,” cried the lad, shaking his head free,
and making a dive at his books, that the poor mother might
not see his hard struggle to keep from crying. “Hungry,
oh, no! Didn’t one of the big boys give me half his
lunch? That’s a roundabout whopper, I know,” he
muttered to himself; “but them eyes, I couldn’t stand ’em,
and she been sick so long. Capital lunch it was, too:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>corned beef sandwiches and pickles—famous! So just
think of yourself, mother, not me. But here comes Eva.
Hurra!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sure enough, that moment Eva Laurence came through
the little gate, sad, weary, and despondent, moving through
the dusky flowers like a spirit of night. She entered the
little sitting-room, and going directly up to her mother, kissed
her in silence. Then she sat down on an edge of the
couch, looked tenderly upon her invalid sister, and whispered
to her,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you had nothing? Has no raven or dove from
Heaven come to feed you, my poor darling?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth shook her head, and tried to smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is mother who needs it most,” she said. “She is not
used to being ill, poor darling, and did without so long herself
before she would own that we were getting short. Have
you brought nothing for her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva shook her head, and whispered, “I did ask. Don’t
think me a coward, Ruth, but they will not break their
rules, down there, for anyone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can we do?” cried the sick girl, clasping her
hands. “I can wait, but mother and poor Jim? Then
you will break down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” answered Eva, almost bitterly. “Mr. Harald has
insisted on sharing his lunch with me every day—that is
the worst of it. I am kept strong and rosy, while you and
mother, who need wholesome food much more, are left here
to suffer. You don’t know, Ruthy, dear, how I have longed
for an opportunity to hide some of his nice things away, and
bring them home; but he always eats with me, and I have
no courage to speak. So I feast like a princess, and feel
guilty as a thief.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you need strength so much more than we do,”
answered Ruth, clasping her pale hands over Eva’s neck,
and kissing her beautiful face. “It would break my heart
to see you growing pale and thin like the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Eva sprang to her feet, stung with unreasonable contrition
for having tasted the food she could not share with
those she loved.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can I do? Is there nothing left? If we could
only bridge over the next two days—but how?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just you hold on,” said little Jim, pitching his pile of
books into the next room, and shutting the door upon them
with a bang, as if nothing less than a great effort could free
him from temptation. “Just you hold on. This is a free
country, and every American has a right to have something
to eat; yes, and be President of the United States, if the
whole people want him to—not to speak of women who
haven’t got their inalienable rights to be men just yet, but
are hungry and thirsty just the same. Give me a chance,
now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of the house James Laurence went, putting on his
thread-bare cap as he ran. The women he left looked at
each other, and almost smiled, his enthusiasm was so contagious.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where can he have gone, what is the boy thinking of,”
said Eva, untying her shabby little bonnet, and sitting
down in helpless expectation. Ruth looked up, smiling.
She had great faith in little Jim, and, spite of all the sweet
patience which made her character so lovely, thought, with
keen physical longing, of the good which might possibly
come out of his sudden resolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We never know what ideas our blessed Lord may
give to a child,” she said; “besides, it does seem impossible
that, in a country like this, God’s innocent creatures can
be left to starve. I think Jim will come back at least with
a loaf of bread; the man who refused us may trust him.
Let us wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This sweet prophecy fell so tranquilly on the soft, summer
air that, spite of themselves, these women began to
hope.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>LITTLE JIMMY GOES AFTER WORK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Little James Laurence gave himself no time for cowardly
thoughts, but ran bravely towards a grocery store,
where the family provisions had been bought in better times,
but where all credit for their present necessities was now
curtly refused.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proprietor of this store had fortunately gone out,
and his wife stood behind the counter, serving a customer.
She was a stout, matronly body, with clear, light-blue
eyes, and a pleasant smile, which was turned with more
than usual kindness on the boy as he entered almost upon
the run. Something in that young face, in the large, eager
eyes, and restless mouth, struck her with a vague idea of
commiseration. When her customer went out, carrying a
brown paper parcel, she folded her plump, round arms on
the counter, and leaning over them in a luxuriously cozy
position, accosted the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Jimmy, what shall we put up for you? One
never sees any of your folks lately. Seem to have took
their trade somewhere else?”</p>

<p class='c006'>James went close up to the counter, and fixed his great,
hungry eyes on hers: the light from a swinging lamp overhead
fell upon his face, and the kind woman read something
there that made her heart ache.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Jimmy, my dear boy, what is it? No trouble, I
hope, beyond the great loss?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Had the woman been cold or angry, that brave boy would
have faced both without a tear; but now, sudden moisture
sparkled in his eyes, and he winked his long, black lashes
over and over again to break it up while he was speaking.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“We haven’t traded here lately, Mrs. Smith, because we
had no money, and your husband got tired of trusting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who told you so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He did.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then he—— Well, he’s one of the best fellows that
ever lived. Does it all for the sake of me and the children—you
must understand that, youngster. He’s generous as
the day, is my husband. Now what is it you want just at
present?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Smith, we haven’t had anything to eat in our
house these three days.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy’s voice broke as he said this, and tears fell from
the eyes he lifted to that woman’s face, whose kindness he
could only see through a mist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not had anything to eat in three days, and I here!
Oh, Jimmy Laurence! what were you all thinking about?
It’s too bad, there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith drew a plump arm across her eyes as she
spoke, then seizing the lad by both hands, she fell to kissing
him over the counter, then gave him a box on the ear, and
pushed him away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why didn’t you come to me? Why didn’t your mother
just step over and tell <i>me</i> about it? Business is business,
but this—— I’ve no patience with you, Jimmy Laurence,
nor none of your tribe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we did not know. He said——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>He</i> said. He can say anything he likes when there’s
no woman by with a will of her own. Now come round
here this very minute and tell me what you want.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mrs. Smith, you are so good! I didn’t mean to
beg for things, or run in debt more than we have; but we
must have something to eat, or—or more of us will be down
sick; but I mean to work for it—that is what I came for.
There is a load of coal coming to-morrow morning. I want
to bring it in for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“You, Jimmy! You bring in coal, poor, slender, pale-faced
darling!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Jim flushed all over at this insinuation against his
manliness, and rolling up the sleeve of his jacket, exposed a
delicate, white arm, with the little hand clenched, and blue
veins thus forced to notice on the wrist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See, Mrs. Smith,” he said, “there’s muscle for a boy;
lean, but tough—just feel it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith did span the delicate wrist with her thumb
and finger, feeling the quick pulse stir feebly to the touch,
and turned away her face to keep the boy from seeing how
close she was to tears—an unusual thing with her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I see; not much flesh to spare.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; some fellows have lots, you know—but that don’t
make ’em powerful. Mrs. Smith, just look at the boys that
ride circus horses, and jump through hoops, how lean they
keep ’em. Just let me feed up a little, and I shall be in
prime working order.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” answered the woman, laughing away the tears
that had actually begun to float in her blue eyes, “we will
feed you up and try.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s splendid,” cried the boy, pulling down his jacket-sleeve,
which was far too short, and woefully thread-bare.
“Then I was thinking of another thing. Saturday nights
you are so busy, and have lots of things to carry home—couldn’t
I do some of that just as well as the bigger boys?
You don’t know how spry I am. Now a basket like that is
nothing to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the noble little fellow lifted down a basket of
groceries that stood on the counter, ready to be carried
home, and dragged it, staggering and breathless, across the
floor, where he gave way and fell across it, utterly insensible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Good Mrs. Smith ran around the counter and lifted the
poor little fellow in her arms. Then she sat down on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>candle-box, and pressing that pale head to her bosom, began
to pat him on the back, rub his hands, and push the hair
off from his forehead with quick, motherly tenderness.
This flamed up to generous rage when her husband came in
with his fresh, prosperous look, and asked her what she was
about, and what boy she was hugging.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come and look for yourself, John Smith, and if you are
not quite a heathen and Sandwich Island hottentot, ask
God to forgive your cruelty. Look at that face; look at
these limp, little hands; just go to the door and look down
street towards the house, where all those morning glories
only cover up starvation. You brought it on, Smith; you
refused them credit when they hadn’t another place to go
to, and the poor things are just starved out—starved out!
Do you hear me, John Smith? And one of ’em, for anything
I know, dead in your wife’s arms—just an awful
judgment against you if he is—poor, sweet, innocent darling,
as wanted only to work for a morsel of bread. He
work? John Smith, I hate you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, come, old woman. Isn’t this going a little
rough?” said the grocer, quite bewildered, and taken aback
by this assault from the most genial and kind creature in
the world. “What has got into your head, and who is that
in your arms?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who? don’t ask me. It’s little Jimmy Laurence, the
son of that splendid policeman, who was shot down in the
street by a highway burglar; one of the steadiest customers
you had when we wanted custom bad enough, mercy knows.
He’s just starved out, mother, sisters and all, and you’ve
done it by telling them you couldn’t trust any longer; but
I’ll pay you off. They shall have everything they want, if
it’s half the store. I’ll send for carts, and have the whole
stock moved into their kitchen. How can you look me in
the face, John Smith? Bring me some water, brandy, peppermint,
hartshorn. Can’t you step about? Or do you
want to kill him over again? There!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>A FEAST AFTER A FAMINE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>John Smith had done his best to obey these confused
demands. He brought water, and held it in a stone pitcher,
while Mrs. Smith thrust her hand to the bottom and sprinkled
little Jimmy’s face; but this failed to bring a sign of life back.
So he put down the pitcher, and brought a little tin measure
half-full of brandy, from some secret corner back in the store,
which his better half snatched from him and held to those
pale lips. Some drops trickled through the teeth that had
fallen slightly apart, and, after a little, the boy began to stir.
Then the good woman burst into tears that came in a torrent,
deluging all the full-blown roses in her cheeks, and
shaking her bosom with sobs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” she cried holding the lad out on her lap as he
struggled to life again; “take him, heft him, make sure
what a shadow he is; then down upon your knees, John
Smith, and thank God that you’re not quite a murderer!
Your meanness will be the death of me yet. Now I warn
you. Me and the children, your duty to take care of us?
John Smith, John Smith, now don’t get me out of
patience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then, what if I say that I am sorry—right down
sorry?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that case, John Smith——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I will let them have anything they want, without
charging till better times come round,” continued the grocer,
soaking a cracker in brandy, and feeding it in fragments
to the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“John—John Smith, I always did say——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And what we haven’t got, I’ll go right out and buy
with our own money—sausages, beef-steak, mutton-chops.
Will that pacify you, Mary Jane?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>So the two set to work in earnest, while little James looked
on, somewhat faint still, and pleasantly bewildered, with a
strong taste of brandy in his mouth, and a warmth in his
whole system that he had not felt for months.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t take too much of that, Jimmy dear,” said Mrs.
Smith, looking up from the basket she was packing.
“Dried-beef, crackers, tea, bread; just stuff in a codfish,
Smith, edgeways down this side, and fill up the chinks with
apples—them red ones are the best. As I was saying,
Jimmy, one cracker can soak up no end of moisture, and
your cheeks are getting red. Now, Smith, run out, and
hurry back with the other things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith went out, and his wife, in her rich benevolence, began
to fill innumerable paper bags with dried prunes, raisins,
loaf-sugar, and other little dainties, which, in her eager haste
to pack up substantials, had escaped her mind till then.
These she pressed down into the basket, and stuffed into
her own pocket, which were quite full when her husband returned
with three or four paper parcels in his hand, looking
more radiant than any man who had bribed his wife’s forgiveness
with a diamond bracelet could have done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, wife, you are ready?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop a minute. John Smith, you are an angel, coat,
boots, and all; but I’ve thought of something. Any fire in
your kitchen, Jimmy, dear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, ma’am. We haven’t had any use for a fire lately!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly. No wood, no coal?”</p>

<p class='c006'>James shook his head. Mrs. Smith opened a side door,
and called to some one in the upper rooms, in which her
family dwelt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kate! Kate Gorman!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, marum, what’s to the fore now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come down stairs, Kate—but no matter. Is there a
good fire in the range?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never a better!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Then take this, and this; broil the steak, fry the ham,
slice up the cold potatoes left after dinner, and fry them;
then heat some tin pans, and put them in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thin I’m not to set the table, marum?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. Make a strong pot of coffee, and one of tea, bring
’em hot; pickles, mustard; and don’t forget some of them
strawberry preserves, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what am I to do with the same, Mistress Smith?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bring them all over to the little white house, with the
morning glories. Open the gate softly, and come round to
the back door. Step down here, Kate, and I will tell you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kate stepped down, and in the darkness of the stair-case
received very particular instructions, which she obeyed implicitly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Mrs. Smith returned to the store, took up the
heavy basket, and called James.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Run on first, now,” she said, “and keep them all busy
about something; take half a dozen apples, and give them
each one; then step back and let me into the kitchen. It is
sure to be ready and neat as wax. I’ve got matches here;
then keep them all busy, and be a little boisterous till I get
things ship-shape.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Little James obeyed; and a few moments after burst in
upon the mournful silence into which his mother and sisters
had fallen, with eyes as bright as stars, and a heap of red
apples in his arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Didn’t I tell you?” he cried out, pouring the apples
into Eva’s lap. “One, two, three, four, five. One a piece,
and another to spare. Here, mother, the biggest for you,
plump and rosy as Mrs. Smith’s cheek, and smelling luscious.
There, Ruthy, darling, I’ll get a knife and peel
yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this the artful little rogue ran into the kitchen, unbolted
the door, and seizing on a knife, was back again in
an instant.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“No, no, James, dear! We must not waste good things
like that,” said Ruth, holding out her slender hand for the
fruit which she regarded with longing eyes. “Put away
your knife—I am in a hurry for my apple.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James sprang to her couch, held the apple to her mouth,
and laughed aloud as her teeth sunk into its crimson side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva, why don’t you pitch into yours?” he said.
“Just watch Ruth, then see how mother is going it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not need it. These two will keep over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes! Keep over, of course. Well, just as you
like. But I say, let to-morrow take care of itself. ‘Hi
diddle diddle, the cat’s in the fiddle, the cow——’ No,
that’s all nonsense; the animal couldn’t do it, but I could.
There, now, what do people have foot-stools lying about
loose for. One step more, and the only gentleman of this
family would have been full length at your feet. Mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy sprung to his mother, and kneeling before her,
pulled down the hand she had lifted to her face, and kissed
it tenderly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, mother! I thought nothing could make you cry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am growing childish, James; sickness weakens one
so,” answered the woman, who was usually firm as iron.
“Besides, gratitude brings tears easy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Ruth, thoughtfully; “for rain, there must
be some warmth; the cold, bitter days only bring down hail
and sleet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell us,” said the mother, wiping her eyes, “where did
you get these?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“From Mrs. Smith, mother. Isn’t she splendid?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you did not ask her again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I did; not for them, but to let me work for something
to keep us alive; so these apples were handy, you
see, and I’m going lots of errands—never you fear!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How they set one craving for more,” said the old lady,
who had the great hunger of a past fever on her, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>maddening—and she eyed the two apples in Eva’s lap ravenously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva reached forth one of the apples, but James put it
back, shaking his head playfully at the mother’s greed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not healthy to eat too much at once. Wait a little,
and then——”</p>

<p class='c006'>That instant the door leading into the kitchen was flung
open, and the delicious scent of hot beef-steak and steaming
coffee filled the little parlor. Eva and Mrs. Laurence
started up, and cried out in their joyful amazement, for
there, lighted by two lamps, was a table, well spread with
all their scarcely-used dishes, on which was a repast such
as they had not tasted for months.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take your place, mother — the armed-chair for you.
Pour out the coffee, Eva, while I roll Ruthy up to the
table. Want help? Well, yes, you may lend a hand
this once, for a cracker or so, soaked in bitterness, don’t
make giants of boys all at once. There, Miss Ruthy, what
do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Ruthy, the moment her chair was drawn close to
the table, folded her hands on the white cloth, and bowed
her face upon it, thanked God as he is seldom thanked at
any meal. Then the bowed heads were lifted, and this little
household, so downcast an hour before, came out into the
sunshine of this marvellous plenty; and those sad faces
grew bright with smiles of thankfulness, while two eager
faces peeped in through the morning glories at the window,
enjoying it all, as if the grocer’s wife and her servant had
been good fairies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>IN THE MORNING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A sudden burst of sunshine had come in on the Laurence
family, brightening the darkness around them. It
glinted through the white curtains, where they floated over
the window, as the morning dawned upon them. At daylight
every one was astir and full of cheerful activity; the
cloud, which had so long hung blackly over that family, had
turned its silver lining, and the very edge seemed radiant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy was up earliest of all, building a fire in the
stove, and making ready for his mother to come down.
He was singing to himself all the time, while a bright tin
tea kettle kept up a murmuring accompaniment, and softened
the air with its vapory steam.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the good housewife came down, pale, gaunt, but
unconsciously almost smiling, and Eva followed, supporting
Ruth with both arms, until the invalid dropped into a chair,
and drew a breath of exquisite satisfaction, as she looked
over the little table her mother’s deft hands had spread.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no prodigal display at this cheerful meal; but
to sit once more at a table, even sparsely spread, was a
delight to the whole family. So thankful smiles dawned
softly on those wan faces, and pleasant looks were cast
through the window, when Mrs. Smith parted the purple
morning glories with her two hands, and called out in a
kind, cheery voice,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, good folks, how do you find yourselves this
morning?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Jim gave a leap from his seat, opened the door,
and let in Mrs. Smith, with a gush of fresh air, that seemed
to set all the morning-glory bells to trembling with delight
as they peeped into the room and tossed drops of dew over
the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“There, now, that’s something like!” said the dame,
gloating over the scene as if every living soul at the table
were her own especial property. “Mercy on us! how we
have all chirked up since last night. Well, Jimmy, what
about the coal?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! I’m on hand!” answered the boy, pushing up the
sleeves of his jacket. “That beef-steak has made me tough
as an oak-knot and springy as a steel-trap. Just show me
the thing that is to be done, and see if I don’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The good dame regarded the delicate child with infinite
compassion, as he made his little boast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes,” she said, “you shall do anything you want
to by-and-by, when good living has toughened you up.
But just now we must give you light jobs, such as carrying
home single parcels, and helping a little at the counter, maybe
now and then—but you mightn’t like that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like what? Why, Mrs. Smith, I’m just in for liking
anything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But then you are so manly, and this is girls’ work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A flush of scarlet came over that bright face, but it passed
away in an instant; and holding up his arms, James asked
the good woman if those hands and wrists were not slender
and white as any girl’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this Mrs. Smith laughed till her sides shook, and
declared that, boy or girl, he was a splendid little fellow as
the sun ever shone on; and if Mrs. Laurence felt as if she
could spare him he might come up to the grocery, and when
there was no light jobs for him to do, there was the cradle to
rock, and the baby to tend up stairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again the hot scarlet swept its way to the lad’s face, and
a choking sense of shame rose to his throat; but he conquered
the rebellious feelings like a hero, and protested,
half crying, when he meant to laugh, that tending a baby
must be prime fun, and rocking a cradle like rowing a boat.
Just what he had wanted to do all his life. Besides, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Smith’s baby was such a first-class young one he wondered
that any girl could be strong enough to hold her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then it is all settled, Jimmy, dear!” exclaimed the
good wife. “Smith couldn’t make much of an opening for
a little chap as had got to learn the business before he
could be of any use; so Kate Gorman and I thought how
handy it would be to have some one about the baby now
and then, just for that, and running the fancy errands, as I
call them,—John Smith don’t like lazy people about him,
and we musn’t eat the bread of idleness, you know, James.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want to earn every mouthful of bread I eat,” said the
boy, bravely, “and enough for others, too. If you’ll set me
to washing dishes and peeling potatoes, I’ll try and do it
well. See if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come along, then,” cried the woman, taking his hand
with a firm clasp. “You’re willing, Mrs. Laurence?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor, pale mother turned wistfully to her boy, who
looked her firmly in the eyes, and smiled as if rocking
cradles and tending babies were the great aim and glory of
his young life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be in the house, and—and you’ll be a mother to
him, Mrs. Smith?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Won’t I?” answered the dame.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you will let him come home sometimes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Every night of his life, and three times a day, if you
want him. Goodness gracious! you don’t expect that we
intend to work a little fellow like that every hour in the
twenty-four. I didn’t come here like a highway robber to
run off with your son, and make a white slave of him; but
just to give him what he seems to want, something to do,
and something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I’m in a hurry to begin,” said James, piling up his
school-books on a set of hanging-shelves over the fire-place,
and resolutely suppressing a big sigh that rose to his lips.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Perhaps the coal would have been too much for me. At
any rate, I can do the other. But I say, Mrs. Smith?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Jimmy. Just thought of something, I see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can I sleep at home? Ruth there is awful timid, and
is sure to lie awake without a man in the house. Besides,
mother, who has always been used to it, and Eva, who likes
to have me about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, I do, darling!” cried Eva, kissing the bright,
young face; and turning to Mrs. Smith, she said, tenderly,
“He does seem to be a protection, and we all love him so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, you do! He’s just the lovingest little shaver
in the world! I only hope that John Smith, junior, will be
up to his mark, which I think he will, being bright as a
new dollar, if sich things are in these greenbacky days.
As for sleeping at home, I never had any other idea. Now,
come away, Jimmy, or something else will turn up; and my
time is short, having left Kate Gorman tending Jerusha
Maria, and breakfast on the table, which Smith won’t touch
a mouthful of till I am there to cut up and pour out, being
of that loving nature—though he does, sometimes, cut up a
little rusty with customers. Come, Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James pulled down his sleeves, and put on his cap, after
which he kissed his mother and sisters with clinging affection,
as if he were starting on a whaling voyage, and
marched off to the grocery, side by side with Mrs. Smith,
who stopped in the store long enough to fill his pockets with
nuts and raisins. Then she took him up stairs, and laid the
baby she called Jerusha Maria into his arms, and taught
him, with brief scolding, how to arrange his knees, so that
the little curly head and the feet, in their tiny worsted
socks, should not come too closely together, while the rest
of that plump body dropped through, and was ignominiously
doubled up, which happened, I am ashamed to say, more
than was proper during the first half-hour of the lad’s promotion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>At these times Mrs. Smith would turn very red, and
wonder if she had done quite wisely in the first outburst of
her warm-hearted charity. While Kate Gorman paused in
her work now and then to shake out the child’s long skirts
and settle her comfortable, where she could bury her chubby
hands in the boy’s hair, and refresh herself with a vigorous
pull now and then, all of which James Laurence endured
with the smiling stoicism of a young Indian.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>SUNSHINE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva Laurence was radiant that day as she walked down
to the wareroom, which scarcely seemed to her like a place
of toil. For the first time in weeks she had left a really
cheerful home. The few days which intervened between
her and the time her first wages would be paid were bridged
over, and she no longer trembled with a wild fear of starvation
for those she loved. Trouble might come, but nothing
quite so dreadful as that. The heroism of her little brother
had worked marvels, for which her heart swelled with tender
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man, who wore that soft, amber beard, was
struck by her brilliant color, and deigned, in a careless way,
to compliment her upon it as she passed him. This she
scarcely noticed, being so occupied with pleasant thoughts,
that his condescension passed unheeded; but when Harold
came up, she reached forth both hands, and, looking in his
earnest face, said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good morning! What a lovely day it is!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, very lovely—a great change,” he murmured, pressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>her hands one instant; then dropping them with a gentle
sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yesterday was so gloomy,” she said; “but this——”</p>

<p class='c006'>She broke off with a faint laugh, for the sky was, in fact,
clouded; and she remembered the floods of silvery light
that had come through the windows the day before, mocking
her anxiety, and turning her heart sick with a thought
of the dear ones at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harold looked at her a moment in a grave, questioning
way. He had seen the young clerk address her, and gave
the smile on her lip, and the glow in her cheek, an interpretation
that made his own greeting constrained and formal.
Eva did not heed this either, the warmth at her heart
was not to be chilled by a cold glance just then, even from
the man who had been kindest to her. She went to a mirror,
in which customers were expected to admire themselves,
and stood before it smoothing her hair, graceful as a bird,
and quite as unconscious of her own beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just then a party came into the show-room, and Harold
turned his attention on them, while Eva stole away from
the mirror, and stood ready to be called, without one trace
of the shrinking pride which had made her so sensitive the
day before.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lady, who soon required her attention, was a stout,
full-featured dame, arrayed in costly silk, flounced, looped,
and puffed, until the rich material was lost in a confusion
of trimmings, which fluttered, like the plumage of an angry
bird, as she walked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up and down the vast show-room this person wandered,
touching first one article, then another, with a heavy hand,
so tightly incased in canary kid gloves, that the delicate
fabric seemed ready to burst at each incautious movement
of the imprisoned fingers. Now and then she would toss
the fabric aside with a scornful little sniff, and ask the obsequious
clerk if he had nothing better than that to show a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>lady who did not stand on prices, but must have the best
of everything when she went a shopping. What would she
please to look at, indeed? Why just what happened to
take her fancy; as for wanting anything particular, she was
a long way beyond that. If the young man had anything
very <i><span lang="fr">rechercher</span></i>, and out of the common, she didn’t mind
looking at it; but, goodness gracious! “Who was that young
woman?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the new customer lifted both hands, and parted her
lips with an expression of growing amazement, while her
eyes, deepening from blue to pale gray, were fastened on
Eva Laurence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That young lady,” answered the clerk, “is Miss Laurence,
just engaged. You are not the first person who has
been struck with her good looks. Haven’t a more genteel
girl in the establishment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The customer dropped her hands, and turning abruptly
from the clerk, walked to the stair-case, where an elderly
man stood waiting for her with the patient indifference of
a person impressed into service he did not like.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman! Herman Ross!” she exclaimed, in an eager
voice, “come here this minute and see for yourself. Did
you ever in your born days! Look there! Isn’t that the
loveliest creature you ever set eyes on?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva was standing at a far-off counter, looking thoughtfully
into the distance, with that soft, happy smile brightening
her whole face, as the full light from a neighboring
window fell upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man paused as he saw the face, and drew back with
a sudden recoil from the eager hand still pressing his arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is this? What does it mean?” he demanded,
turning white, and looking forward with a wild stare. “It is
twenty years. I cannot go back to that, but—but—be
quiet! Leave me alone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man walked forward unsteadily, and, like one impelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>to an action against his own consciousness, until he
came close to Eva, but with such noiseless action that she
did not heed him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you tell me your name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva started. The voice that addressed her was so low
and hoarse that surprise became almost terror in her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My name? My—my name? Did you ask that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes—yes!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva turned her eyes on the white face which was reading
hers with such pathetic earnestness, and all the angry surprise
his abrupt address had kindled, died out under the
sad penetration of his glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My name is Laurence—Eva Laurence,” she answered,
with gentle courtesy. “Pray, why do you care to know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can scarcely tell you, young lady. Excuse me, there
must be some mistake. Laurence—did you say Laurence?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is my name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And your father?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My father is dead,” answered the girl, with a flush about
her drooping eyelids, under which quick tears were springing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dead? But your mother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is living.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! But you have other relatives—brothers, sisters,
perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I have a brother and one sister.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like you? Is she beautiful like you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not suppose any one could think of me, looking at
her,” answered Eva, speaking her honest conviction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should like to see your sister and your mother,” said
the man, “Might I? Would it be unpardonable if I called
on them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know, we have seen few people since my father
was killed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Killed, did you say? Killed?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Yes,” answered Eva, almost in a whisper; “my father
was shot down in the street by a man he was arresting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shot down! That was terrible! Forgive me, young
lady, if I have made you cry. Nothing was further from
my thoughts.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>TRYING THINGS ON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The stout woman who had brought on this conversation
came up now, her face beaming with curiosity and her dress
fluttering ludicrously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well Herman, don’t you think I have been kept waiting
about long enough? One gets out of patience, Miss,
especially when one is used to being studied and waited
on by no end of servants, and such like. Now, if you’ll
just look out of the window, you’ll find my footman
watching the front entrance like a cat, with one hand on the
carriage-door; for he knows well enough there’d be a high
breeze if I was kept waiting a single minute; so you mustn’t
wonder if I am just a trifle hard on shop girls—I always
keep them on the jump.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I am quite ready to wait on you,” said Eva smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter smiled also, for her genial nature was always
ready to meet cordiality half way, and she said blandly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you mind just stepping over among the lace
shawls, they tell me you’re hired to show such things off,
and I might take one, if they’ve got something a little
superber than the shawl Mrs. Lambert just brought home
from Europe. She sits right before me in church, you
know, and wears it in the most aggravating way. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>time I kneel down, that eternal pattern of morning-glory
vines, creeping over her shoulder, is before my eyes, daring
me to get anything like it, if I can, for love or money. I’m
expected to feel meek and humble all the same. It isn’t in
human nature. That woman and I can’t be members of the
same church if she keeps this thing up. One’s moral character
won’t stand such strains; kneeling at the same altar
with a woman who wears a fifteen hundred dollar lace shawl,
and mine only a thousand, and Carter fairly wallowing in
greenbacks, is more than I can stand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva listened till her amused smile deepened into a laugh,
which the man heard with a thrill of pain that ran through
him like an arrow. Tilled with recollections that made his
blood stir like old wine in his heart, he drew back and
watched the girl narrowly, as she conversed with his sister.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! if you want a fifteen hundred dollar shawl, it is an
easy thing to get. Shall I go with you to the lace counter?”
said Eva, quite unconscious of the stranger’s regard.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it must have a morning-glory vine running through
it, leaves and bells like hers, only more of ’em. I’m resolved
that our church shall see no costlier shawl than
Richard Carter’s lady wears, while it sends up a steeple.
Now just tell that young man to show us the very best he’s
got. Nothing less than fifteen hundred, understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The light-haired clerk heard all this conversation, and
followed the party up to the lace counter, where he became
very officious in exhibiting shawls, to which he affixed enormous
prices with a solemn gravity of countenance that impressed
Mrs. Richard Carter greatly. This helped her to fix
upon a beautiful fabric, certainly, but one she would not
have deigned to purchase at its real value, which was just
five hundred dollars less than the depletion of that huge
roll of greenbacks with which the good lady went armed on
her shopping excursions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” she said, crushing the money she had left into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>her reticule-purse, and winding the chain about her wrist
and little finger, on which she wore a great diamond ring
outside the glove, “I begin to feel like myself again. You
are sure that a higher-priced shawl than that isn’t to be
found in New York, young man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Positive of it, madam: for I don’t believe there is another
salesman in New York that would have the courage to
set that figure,” he muttered, after the first brief reply.
“Not another imported. Rest content that you have <i>the</i>
shawl of the season, madam. Shall I send it to your carriage?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, give it to my footman, a tall fellow in maroon livery,
with a gold band. You’ll see Carter’s and my monogram
on the carriage-door.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The clerk went away with a droll look in his eyes, and a
smile struggling on his lip; for he was well acquainted with
the class of persons to which his customer belonged—a class
that, like many other strange things in social life, is an offshoot
of a civil war, which has served to vulgarize wealth
attained by accident or fraud, until refined people shrink
from competition with it in sensitive shame.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m ever so much obliged to you for showing off the
patterns for me,” said Mrs. Carter, turning toward Eva
with cordial warmth. “The people always are obliging in
this establishment; know in an instant when a lady carries
the look of money in her face; but I must say, that you are
the most stylish girl that I’ve seen here yet; was struck
with you the first time, wasn’t I, Herman?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter turned in search of her brother, who
had retreated out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! there he is, mousing off by himself; but he don’t
take his eyes from your face. No wonder, there is enough
in it to strike anyone all in a heap. He don’t seem to get
over it, though. Awful sensitive! But we all are that.
Exquisite feelings, born with us. He’s my brother, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>know—my only brother. Left New York when he was a
young man, and just come back again. I shouldn’t have
known him, he’s so altered. Do you think we look alike?
He used to be very handsome, and people took us for twins.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A smile quivered across Eva’s lip, and the lids drooped
over her laughing eyes; but both died out suddenly as her
glance fell on the strange man, who seemed to shrink away
from her mirth as if it wounded him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must not laugh,” said Eva, in her thoughts. “Perhaps
he feels how ridiculous his relative makes herself, and
is annoyed by it. But why does he look at me with such
sorrowful eyes. Yes, he is a handsome man, and seems to
be both sensible and sensitive; but <i>her</i> brother—I don’t
believe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man came forward as these thoughts disturbed the
girl, asked Mrs. Carter if she was ready to return home,
and, lifting his hat with grave politeness, led the way down
stairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tall footman was at his post, shut the carriage-door
with a lordly bang, and climbed up to his place by the
coachman, leaving the two persons inside to themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, now,” said Mrs. Carter, eagerly, “did you ever
see anything so handsome? She quite took my breath
away at first. As for you, Ross, well the color hasn’t come
back to your face yet. What <i>is</i> the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I saw,” answered the man, dreamily, “I saw that
she was beautiful.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>THE LAMBERT MANSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Lamberts were a proud family, aristocratic in birth
intellect and breeding. This branch with which our story
deals, had added great wealth to its other possessions by
marriage with a rich man’s only daughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert was not content with a home in the Fifth
Avenue, which many a small monarch might have coveted
for a regal palace, but she must have it altogether different,
more superb than her neighbors, unique as well as magnificent.
Mrs. Lambert had led society so long, and travelled
so much, that commonplace things, bought by the yard,
and arranged exactly like every other house of the class,
were far beneath her aspirations. Her stately mansion
abounded in beautiful objects, rare and costly, which she
had been years in collecting at every curiosity-shop and
brie-a-brae sale in Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ground on which the Lambert mansion was built
had been a farm, or rather homestead, when its present mistress
was born. As the city throve and grew around it,
that which had been a modest competency became enormous
wealth, in the heart of which she replaced the old homestead
with a palace, and turned the old garden and goodly
home lot into a wilderness of flowers. These grew and
bloomed beautifully, in spite of three or four grand old
forest trees which still kept a firm root-hold in the soil.
Standing in front, with those broad steps winding up to the
entrance through their heavy stone balustrades, you saw
nothing of the lovely green paradise that bloomed on the
other side of that costly building. The plate glass windows
were so brilliant, the stone work so elaborate, that an idea
of nature took you by surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Leave the avenue only for a minute, turn down the first
cross street, and the bloom, the rich greenness, and rustle
of leaves, come upon you like enchantment. Through them
all, you saw sheets of curved glass rolling downward like
sunlit waves of the ocean; and through them come the
splendid glow of blossoming flowers, among which you could
see birds fluttering, and a fountain shooting up diamonds.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bit of paradise had formerly been old Mr. Lambert’s
kitchen-garden, planted around the edge with currant-bushes,
and with a thicket of feathery fennel rising like a
green fountain in the center. Where the thicket of tea-roses
blossomed most richly, he had planted an asparagus
bed and sold the product to market women at the highest
price he could get. That great plot of heliotrope and scarlet
geraniums, gave him a rich harvest of beets and carrots,
in the good old days. But of all the old, thrifty life, there
was nothing left save one great white rose-tree, that still
clambered up a green post, and half buried a pretty wren-house
in its sturdy foliage.</p>

<p class='c006'>This wren-house the old man had devised when he
planted the rose on his daughter’s birth-day, a bit of affectionate
sentiment, she could never force herself to root from
the gorgeous splendor of her after life. So there the rose-tree
bloomed, and the wren-house gave forth yearly broods
of young birds, that in their turn built nests, and filled the
little spot with songsters bright and beautiful as the flowers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert was a middle-aged lady now, and the
white rose had died more than once in its main stock since
she was born. Still shoots sprang up from the roots again,
and the bush remained itself; while an old, old man, who
had worked on the original homestead, and now lived over
one of the stables, kept the wren-house thatched, and the
ground rich around the old memorial bush, sometimes crying
a little as he dug up the earth, and counted the years
since the first slender twig was planted by the hand so long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>cold, while he stood and looked on, wondering if the sprout
would take root.</p>

<p class='c006'>This old man, with hair as white as snow, was in the
garden a few days after the opening of this story, looking
weird and strange in all that bloom as the old white rose
itself; this, being out of flower, was gnarled and rough,
having nothing but green leaves to shelter the wren-house
with. Some of its branches had died with age, and with
his withered and trembling hands the old gardener was
attempting to cut the lifeless wood away, a task that went
to his heart, for it seemed like digging his own grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the old gardener hacked at the rough wood, a man,
who had been loitering along the side-walk, stopped, as
many a curious person had done before, and looked in upon
the pleasant spot, while his hand held lightly by one of the
iron rails. It was a white, thin hand, but not of that delicate
mould which entire freedom from toil, from the cradle
up, leaves to the possessor. Some time in its owner’s life
that hand had wrought and toiled, though the palm was
soft now and the fingers slender.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something in the face, which looked over the iron railing,
seemed to interest the old man, who paused with his knife
half through the wood of the rose-bush, and shading his
eyes, took a keen survey of its features.</p>

<p class='c006'>As if impelled by some mysterious attraction, the old
gardener left his knife sticking in the wood, and moved with
slow difficulty toward the iron railing, exactly as if the man
had summoned him. Indeed, it almost seemed as if he
had done so, for the moment those hobbling steps paused
the stranger began to ask questions, which the old man,
usually so grim and crusty with persons he did not know,
answered with prompt respect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A beautiful garden this,” said the stranger, gently,
meeting the old man’s gaze with a look that had something
anxious in it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Well, yes, I should think so. It has been a growing a
good many years, and from the first was rich.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you the gardener?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, I? Of course. What else should I be, if not
the madam’s gardener? I, who helped her to dig up her
first little flower-bed when she wasn’t more than so high.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the old man bent down a little, and measured off
the empty space about to the level of his rheumatic knees.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you seem a very old man to work at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do I? Well, it isn’t any hard work I do. There is a
boy out there by the green-house that keeps himself busy
obeying my orders, and he gets along pretty well considering.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the old man pointed to a tall, stalwart laborer, some
thirty-five years of age, who really did the work of the
place, and whom the old man considered as a boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not so old as to want help, you know,” continued
the old gardener; “but the madam——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think you said she had lived here from a child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger’s voice was hoarse and constrained, as he
interrupted the old man with this question.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gardener brushed back the gray hair from his ears,
as if something in the voice bewildered him; then he
answered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, everybody here knows that. The big wooden
house is gone, but that heap of stone stands over the old cellar,
and <i>she</i> lives like a queen where her father died. The
great difference is, she picks roses where he sold leets and
carrots; and them green-houses stand just where his pigpens
were. Wonderful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you have not told me who the lady is?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not told you? Ha! ha! As if everybody didn’t
know Mrs. Lambert.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The lady is married, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>These words fell heavily, like drops of lead, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>stranger’s white lips, and his hand, which clasped the railing,
tightened spasmodically around the iron.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Married! Why that was years and years ago. She
went across the seas to some foreign countries after her
father died, and came back with a husband and a son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her son?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lord a mercy! No! Step-child—a first rate shaver
by Mr. Lambert’s first wife; but she don’t seem to know
the difference. He’ll get every cent she’s worth, and that’s
a heap of money, I tell you. But there she goes down the
back walk toward the green-house, you can see her white
dress through the bushes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger grasped the iron spikes with both hands
now, and the face, which looked over them, was white as
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me in! Let me pass through!” he exclaimed,
looking wildly around for a gate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I should rather think not; no trespassers ever get
in to tread down the madam’s flowers. She wouldn’t allow
it. Halloo! what are you about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger had discovered a gate upon the latch, and
opening it, much to the old man’s surprise, passed into the
garden.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop there! Hold on, I say!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger did not even hear this quivering protest, but
walked swiftly across the garden and entered a green-house,
that rose in its midst like a mammoth bird-cage of rolling
glass, choked up with leaves and blossoms. Beneath an
acacia-tree, covered with soft, yellow blossoms, stood a lady,
with her white arm uplifted, gathering a spray of the delicate
plant, which she was about to group with a quantity of
moss-roses and heliotrope, which she had plucked in the open
air. She dropped her hand in amazement as a strange man
entered the green-house, and the branch she had half broken
rustled slowly back to its place.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Elizabeth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The lady started. A cry that rose to her lips as her
name was uttered, broke into something like a sob, and she
seemed about to escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned now, trembling, white, shrinking with dread,
and looked into the man’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You—you——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her blanched lips could utter no more, she seized the
acacia by its stem, and the trembling of her arm shook
down the blossoms like rain upon her bowed head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>DAWNING PROSPERITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Little James Laurence worked manfully in his new
vocation. He carried home packages of tea, pounds of
sausages, and paper bags stuffed with crackers, quicker
than any boy of his size was ever known to do before.
He ran errands up and down stairs for Kate Gorman, and
soon learned to toss “Jerusha Maria” in the air with an
adroitness that threw her into an ecstasy of crowing, and
set her long clothes to fluttering through and through, like
the plumage of a bird. He learned to put on her tiny socks
when she shook them from her plump, little feet; and never
touched the top of her head without trembling for the delicate
spot there, which Mrs. Smith had anxiously warned
him of. He kept the child’s cradle in a soft, monotonous
jog while she slept, without complaint, though the day was
ever so bright, and the cheery sound of boys playing marbles,
on the side-walk, tempted him sorely at times.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>For all this James got his board, and two dollars a week,
a sum that brought a marvellous quantity of groceries every
Saturday night, as Mrs. Smith reckoned up accounts, and
sent the boy home rejoicing to spend the Sabbath with his
family.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva, too, had received her last instalment of wages, and
Mrs. Laurence grew stronger and stronger each day, as that
heavy burden of anxiety was lifted from her shoulders. As
for Ruth, who lived in the happiness of those around her,
this gleam of sunshine revived her strength and beauty
as if she had been a flower. With the reaction of infinite
relief, she began to wonder if there was anything on earth
that she could do for the general happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>To say that Mrs. Smith was the good angel of this little
household, would be to cast a certain degree of ridicule on
this robust, ruddy-faced, and genial-hearted woman: for she
had nothing of the angel about her, except that sweet snow-plumed
spirit of mercy that brooded in her warm heart, as
doves make a nest of soft materials, and glorify them with
the cooing music of perfect love.</p>

<p class='c006'>No, Mrs. Smith was not an angel, by any means. She
had some household ways that angels would have considered
out of place, not to mention her name, which was the reverse
of poetical to say nothing of the seraphic. Sometimes the
good woman scolded her husband roundly, and once or twice—I
tell this with infinite reluctance—she had been known to
snatch Jerusha Maria from the soft depths of her cradle,
after that young lady had cried till her face was of a lovely
purple, and shake her till the feathers would have flown,
had her mother been an angel, and thus endowed her with
the plumage of a seraph.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fact, Mrs. Smith was a kind, wholesome specimen of
the middle class American housewife, and a good friend to
the Laurence family. That was all. She had, when business
grew prosperous, taken a lad from the street, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>more impulsively than we have seen her adopt our friend
James, and believing herself to have met with success on
that occasion, was the more willing to try a new experiment
of mercy. But, like a good many other kind-hearted people,
she forgot to guard herself against the infirmities of
human jealousy, and was quite reckless of the fact that
Jared Boyce received his fellow clerk with scowls of dissatisfaction,
and that sneers of disdain curled his incipient
red moustache, whenever the lad came near him.</p>

<p class='c006'>This youth was left in charge of the store whenever
Smith went out to make purchases, and his wife was called
up stairs, which happened frequently, as time wore on, for
Jerusha Maria was cutting her teeth in a vicious state of
mind, and Kate Gorman had more than she could do in the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course, this threw young James more frequently into
the store, where Jared found occasion to impose all sorts of
petty indignities upon him. These crafty annoyances the
boy, too noble for complaint, bore with a degree of manliness
that threatened to baffle the object his enemy had in
view. One thing James saw clearly and felt, as only a
proud, sensitive child could, Jared Boyce did not want him
about. Why?</p>

<p class='c006'>James asked himself this question again and again, with
tears in his eyes, sometimes in the depths of the night, when
a vague sense of trouble would keep him awake, sometimes
when burdened with a heavy basket in the street; but he
took counsel of no one, and bore his own trouble in silence
like a little man as he was.</p>

<p class='c006'>After awhile things changed somewhat with the lad.
Jared cast off his morose bearing, and made some cringing
advances toward cordiality, from which the boy shrunk
with sensitive dread.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day, when James had gone out with some packages,
Smith came into the store in haste, while a countryman who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>had brought in a load of produce, waited at the counter
with a whip in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thirty-seven dollars,” said Smith, opening the money
drawer and counting some bank notes that he found there.
“No need of waiting; generally enough on hand for small
amounts like this. Ha, Boyce! who has been paying out
money. I’m ten dollars short. Run up and ask the old
woman if she’s taken any. If she has, tell her to shell out,
the man is waiting!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce turned slowly, and went up stairs. He paused
once or twice while ascending, and bit his white lips, as if
doubtful what course to pursue. Then he lifted his head
with a dash, ran the fingers of one hand through his fire-red
hair, and flung open the door where Mrs. Smith was sitting
with “Jerusha Maria” on her lap, rubbing her gums with
the handle of a dessert-spoon, in the desperate hope that she
was aiding a refractory tooth to cut.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Smith, the boss wants to know if you’ve took any
money from out of the drawer. He wants to make up a
bill.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, me! Goodness gracious! What do I want
of money, with Jerusha Maria crying her eyes out, and I
trying my best to set her teeth of an edge. Tell Smith not
to make a fool of himself, but search his own pockets.
Dear me! will that man never have no consideration!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you haven’t got the money?” said Jared, looking
over Mrs. Smith’s head, as if he were questioning the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Money! Not a cent! Don’t bother me!” cried the
dame flinging down the spoon, and searching the child’s
mouth with her motherly finger. “What do I know about
the store, with this little angel screaming like mad with the
ache of her precious gums! There, there! mother knows
they buse her darling! Oh, goodness! Kate Gorman,
come here. I’m sure there’s one coming through just under
my finger; look, now.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Kate set down a saucer she was wiping, dried her hands
hastily on the dish towel, and came forward beaming with
expectation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just turn her purty face to the light,” she cried, sinking
on her two knees before the child, and peering into the
mouth in which sobs and screams were half smothered.
By gorry! and so it is, true enough! like the pint of a
needle agin yer finger. There, now, the swate crathur will
have some peace an’ quietness. “Boyce, go down an’ tell the
master that it has come, and not stand gauking there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce, who had been in no haste to go down, closed the
door softly, and stood ruminating on the outside. Directly
his face brightened with some new-born thought, and he
entered the store with his usual manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Smith says she hasn’t took a cent from the draw,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hasn’t taken a cent from the drawer!” exclaimed
Smith, excitedly. “Then where the thunder has that ten-dollar
bill gone! I left three in that identical drawer not
more en half an hour ago, and now only two is left. Who
has been back of the counter since I went out?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a soul but me and Mrs. Smith’s new boy, Jim.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith’s countenance fell. He went to the drawer again,
drew it completely out from under the counter, turned it
bottom up, with a bang, and once more searched every fragment
of paper with care.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he remembered the countryman, who was waiting
patiently, and assorting out some small bills, paid him in
moody silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce was very busy all this time re-arranging boxes,
and dusting the counter; but his furtive eyes now and then
turned upon Smith with the look of a hound that fears
chastisement, and his work was done in a quick, nervous
fashion, quite unusual to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meantime, little Jim came in with an empty basket on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>his arm, bright and radiant as a June morning. Smith
lifted his eyes from the desk where he stood, and when he
saw that cheerful, honest face, his own brightened. He had
intended to question the boy, but thought of his wife, and
had not the heart to do it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is another basket to be taken to Mrs. Lambert’s
cook, who comes down all this way because of one of the
footmen being the cousin of my poor dead mother; so look
sharp and get the things there in time,” said Boyce, swinging
a basket up to the counter. “Tell her every article is
choice, as choice can be, such as we don’t give to common
customers, by no manner of means. There, now, heave
away!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>GOSSIP IN THE BASEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>James received the basket, and carried it off manfully, but
began to drag in his walk, and set the heavy load down for
a moment’s rest after he had carried it a block or two, for
his spirit ran far beyond his strength, poor fellow! When
he entered the spacious kitchen in Mrs. Lambert’s dwelling,
the perspiration was standing in drops on his forehead and
he staggered in his walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two or three servants were in the kitchen, gathered in a
group around a sallow and highly dressed young lady, whose
French cap was in a flutter from the active movement of
her head, and whose hands were now and then taken from
the pockets in her apron to illustrate what she was saying
with peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>So occupied and interested was this group that no one observed
the tired boy, who stood panting over the basket he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>had placed upon the floor, waiting for some one to claim its
contents. Even the cook, whose duty it was, stood by her
table with the rolling-pin resting motionless on a half-formed
pie-crust, her hands white with flour, and her mouth
open with eager curiosity, listening to the female in that
French cap so intently that she had no eyes nor ears for
anything else.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you the man was a total stranger. Old Storms
can’t remember ever seeing him before—and he remembers
every one that ever came here since the deluge. He protested
against the man’s coming into the garden, and held
the gate to with all his might; but the stranger just pushed
him aside, and tramping across the garden, made straight
for the conservatory without a word, as if everything belonged
to him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you ever see such impudence,” said a jaunty footman
whose eyes were bent admiringly on the speaker. She
nodded an assent, and proceeded with her narrative.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old Storms followed after just as fast as he could hobble.
First he heard a little scream, then a dead silence, and
through the glass he could see the tall acacia-tree bending
and fluttering as if a storm had struck it. Then came
quick words. The man spoke low and steadily, but madam’s
voice rose high and sharp as no one ever heard it before;
and when old Storms looked in, she was white as a ghost,
and shaking like a leaf. She saw his face peeping through
the door, and lifting her arms, motioned-him away, while
her eyes seemed to shine right through him like burning
stars.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But who was the man? Why didn’t the madam order
him out?” exclaimed the cook, grasping her rolling-pin
with all the force of a large, heavy hand. “I only wish it
had a been me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it was madam who ordered old Storms out; she
that stands everything from him, even to being snubbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>about picking her own flowers,” answered the maid. “I
don’t understand it. She must have known the man, yet
she was afraid of him, she was white as a sheet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And quivering all over like a jelly,” broke in the cook.
“Wasn’t that what you said, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said nothing of the kind, cook,” answered the maid,
with infinite disdain. “No one was talking of jellies, that
I know of, so please to keep such comparisons for the
kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The cook turned her back on the exasperated maid, and
began rolling out her pie-crust with vigor, muttering to herself,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sich airs! Just as if wearing a high-flying cap made
some people better than other people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you didn’t tell, Miss Ellen, what came of it all;
which of the madam’s people was it who showed that
strange person into the street?” inquired the dashing
footman, who had listened so eagerly to Ellen’s story.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Which of ’em? Not you, Robert, by any manner of
means. The truth was, old Storms kept guard over the
conservatory a full half hour. Then the man came out,
looking stern and white, as if he had been committing
murder. He passed right by the old man without so much
as looking at him, and tramped off through the garden-gate,
wading right through a bed of heliotropes in full blossom,
and coming up against that old white rose-bush, with the
wren’s-nest over it. Then he stopped as if some one had
shot him, and leaning his head against the post, shook till
the leaves trembled and the branches rustled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old Storms could not wait to see anything more, for
looking through the glass, he saw madam lying in a heap,
with her head against the marble of the fountain, not a
mite of color in her face, her hands, or her neck. At first
he thought she was dead, and began to wring his old hands
over her, and cry out so loud that the under-gardener heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>him. Dropping everything he ran into the green-house
and lifted her up while old Storms came in after me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, I went out with a flask of hartshorn in one
hand, and aromatic vinegar in the other. That poor old
fellow went before, with great round tears rolling down
his cheek; but I was too frightened to cry, you may believe
that. Why Mr. Robert there could have knocked me down
with a feather.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if I could be hired to do anything so exceedingly
unmanly,” said the footman, bowing low, with one hand on
his heart, “the bare idea is wounding to—to—— Yes,
wounding, Miss Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I didn’t mean it as such. The feathery idee was a
comparison, not an actuality, Mr. Robert. Excuse me, I
meant no harm; there isn’t a girl living who appreciates
your superfluous qualities better than I do. Pray forgive
me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert allowed himself to be appeased, and took Miss
Ellen’s hand affectionately in his, while he besought her to
go on with her touching narrative.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There isn’t much more to tell,” said Ellen, leaving her
hand rather longer than was necessary in the footman’s
clasp. “I found her what seemed to me stone-dead, her
hands cold as ice, her face white as the marble over which
the water dripped, her hair wet with the spray of the fountain.
Old Storms began to cry, and the under-gardener—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Miss Ellen, what of him?” demanded the footman,
tossing the clinging hand away indignantly. “What
of that cretur? Did he have the cheek to offer to help, and
lift the madam up, and, perhaps, touch that hand in doing
of it—that hand which mine—— Speak, Ellen, what <i>did</i>
that wretched being presume to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Robert, he only lifted her up from the cold
marble of the floor, and laid her on a garden-sofa.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He did? That is enough. I understand the rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Perfidious woman! You helped him! Your hands met—your
eyes——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, Robert, no! I hardly looked at him. But what
could we do? Old Storms hasn’t the strength of a baby,
and I was so frightened!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you talked with him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only to get all the particulars which the crabbed old
man wouldn’t talk about. In fact, he tried to make me
believe that nothing out of the common had happened;
that no strange man had been there; and he was awful
huffy with the under-gardener for coming in after me. In
fact, if I had depended on old Storms, not a soul in this
house would have known anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We don’t know much as it is,” muttered the cook,
kneading handsful of butter into her pie-crust, while Ellen
made the most of her story.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you may know this, if you’ll take the trouble to
understand,” answered Ellen, with a toss of her head. “It
was full ten minutes before the madam came out of her
fainting fit, and when she did, it was to sit up like a ghost
and look around with frightened eyes, as if she dreaded
something, and there old Storms stood half crying. When
she saw me the color came back to her face with a rush,
and in her grand way, she asked what I was doing there.
When I attempted to answer, she pointed to the door and
said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go, leave me. There was nothing the matter, that you
should be called. The heavy perfume of the flowers made
me faint; but Storms was enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then she arose with her haughtiest air and swept by
me like a queen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rather hard on you, Ellen. I should say it all meant
that you wasn’t wanted,” said the cook, dusting the flour
from her hands with a sort of glee, for she had made that a
pretence for clapping them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I wasn’t addressing my conversation to you,” replied
Ellen, with lofty disdain, and was about to say to Mr.
Robert “that when I went into the house madam passed
me without a word, and shut herself up in her own room
where she has been these two hours without ringing her
bell once. Now I say that looks mysterious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sensationing, at least,” answered the footman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>JAMES MAKES AN ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Please, will you tell some one to empty the basket.
I’ve been away from the store ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the voice of little James, who had been modestly
waiting to be noticed while this eager conversation went on,
and now addressed Ellen as the most important person in
the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Groceries,” cried the girl, with a magnificent lift of the
head. “Do I look as if groceries belonged to my department,
boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give ’em to me,” cried the cook, swinging the basket
up to a dresser with the nerve of a giant. “There is a
mighty difference between buttoning a lady’s boots and
cooking her dinner, of course. We are all fine ladies here,
only it hasn’t got about yet. There, now, run home as
quick as you like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has that boy been listening all this time?” cried
Ellen, casting angry glances at the blushing young face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I tried all I could not to hear,” said the boy, modestly.
“It was not my fault; I wanted to get away from
the first.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, mind you hold your tongue about anything I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>been saying, or you’ll get into trouble, and lose madam’s
custom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just as <i>I</i> say,” answered the cook, defiantly.
“You stick to your ribbons and curling stick, Ellen Post; I
and this boy can get along very well without you. There’s
your empty basket, my little fellow; now run home, and
don’t mind what any one says to you but myself; but remember
to come earlier to-morrow, for I am bound to go out
early anyhow, having a little business at the Savings Bank
that must be seen to, not being one of them stuck-up persons
that heap everything on their own backs—I look out for a
rainy day, I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the cook lifted her head in the air and took a deliberate
survey of Ellen Post, at which stage of the quarrel
James left the kitchen, full of wonder that there could be
so much discontent in a house like that.</p>

<p class='c006'>On his way home, the lad almost ran against a gentleman
who was walking slowly along the side-walk. In attempting
to avoid the collision his foot slipped, and he fell forward
upon the flags with a force that stunned him for the
moment. The gentleman lifted him from the stones in
considerable agitation, and putting back the hair from his
forehead, examined the bruise, which was swelling rapidly
upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My poor boy,” he said, in a voice so sweet with compassion
that tears swelled into the lad’s eyes at once,
though the pain of his fall had brought no moisture there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it’s nothing, sir! We boys are used to such tumbles.
You are only too kind about it. All my own fault,
sir, thank you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, but you are hurt, and need help. I cannot let you
go home alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James tried to get up a brave laugh; but the blow had
made him dizzy, and he staggered forward rather than
walked.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Where do you live? Not far from here, I suppose,”
inquired the stranger, with gentle kindness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! I live in one place and tend store in another,”
answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You had better go home, then, and I will get a doctor to
put something on your forehead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, a doctor for this? Oh, my! that would be
funny! The boys would all laugh at me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still you have had a serious fall, and such things are
often dangerous. Tell me where you live?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, sir, if you insist upon it, I am going right by the
house. It won’t take long to put a piece of wet paper on a
fellow’s forehead; and as you want to see it done, I haven’t
any objection, though mother and Ruthy will be surprised.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So James, unconscious of the tender gratitude which
prompted the act, gave one hand to the stranger, and the
two walked along together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your name, my little man?” inquired the
stranger, greatly interested in the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“James. James Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Laurence? I met a young lady of that name not long
ago—a very beautiful young lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was she in a store?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tall, with eyes that look like water in a shady place?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She had soft, pleasant eyes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did she tell you her other name? Was it Eva?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was her name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then, you’ve seen one of the brightest, sweetest,
darlingest girls that ever lived, sir; let me tell you that, if
she is my sister.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then the young lady is really and truly your sister?”
said the man, and a strange tone of disappointment broke
into his naturally sad voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really and truly she is my own sister; but no wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>you can’t just believe it, she’s so much grander and brighter
than any of us. I never see a great, stone house like
that I have just come away from, without thinking our Eva
was made to live in it, and be a queen, with lots of common
people to wait on her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What house have you just come from, my little friend?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Lambert’s!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ha!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is that great house on the corner, with so many flowers
behind it. Eva is so fond of flowers, too. It is she who
trains up the morning glory vines, and plants sweet peas
and crimson beans among them. Sometimes I almost like
our little garden as well as Mrs. Lambert’s. We plant our
own flowers, you see, and that makes a difference in the way
of enjoying them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does, indeed! Do you go to Mrs. Lambert’s often?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never went there till Mrs. Smith took me into the
grocery; but I used to pass by the garden every day. It
was a little farther to school through that street, but I loved
to walk slow and look through the iron fence, where the
great tea-roses and geraniums seemed to set the ground on
fire, and that white-headed old man moving about among
them was like a picture. At first he was awful cross, and
would order me away, but after a while, when he saw that
I never so much as reached my hand through, he would
sometimes chuck a rose, or a sprig of something sweet
through the fence, and go away chuckling to himself. I
always carried the flowers to Ruthy, or our Eva, they are
both so fond of them, you know, and this made us all just a
little acquainted with the great house up yonder. I dare
say the proud lady would think our garden no great things,
but the girls love it a good deal better than she loves hers,
I promise you; for, go by ever so often, I hardly ever see
her in it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you ever spoken to the lady?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“What—me? No, indeed; but she spoke to me once!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How was that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One day when I was walking with my sister Eva, she
leaned out of her carriage, and looked after us in a strange
earnest way, that made Eva pull down her veil. The next-day,
as I was going along by the garden-fence, the lady was
close by me picking flowers on the other side. I suppose
my eyes looked greedy for them, for she called to me in a
kind, sweet way, and reached some of her flowers through
the railing. I was afraid to touch them at first; but she
smiled, and said, Old Storms had told her how I loved to
hang about the railing, and that I had a young lady with
me once, who seemed as fond of flowers as I was.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! I said, a thousand times more so. Eva loves them
better than anything in the world. When I said Eva, the
lady seemed to grow restless, and dropped some of her
flowers without noticing it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a singular name,” she said, “that is——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is, for poor people, I said, when she stopped, as if
afraid of hurting my feelings. Yes, we all know that; but
then our Eva never seemed like poor people. Everybody
thinks she is a lady—and so she is, every inch of her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The madam smiled when I said this, and her face grew
red as a rose all in a minute, as if I had been praising her
instead of Eva, which wasn’t likely, being only a little boy,
and she a splendid lady. Then she asked me about my
father who was killed, sir, when we needed him most; and
about my mother who was working so hard to keep us
together, and said that perhaps she would come some time
and see our garden, if it was so pretty; but she never
came.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger listened to that frank, young voice with
gentle interest, asking a few questions now and then, always
calculating to draw out some detail about the lady of
the great house, but without directly alluding to her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“But since then you have been to the house?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir, after I went into business. That was what
took me there to-day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James spoke guardedly, now he remembered that what
he had overheard was not his to tell. The stranger showed
no disposition to carry the subject further, but fell into
thought, and moved forward as if he had been alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there! you see Eva’s morning glories running
up the window,” cried the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this your home, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir, while we can keep it, that is; but who knows
what good luck will come next! If I were only a man
now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you long to be a man?” said the stranger, looking
down at the lad with sorrowful interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I do. Then, sir, I would keep that roof over my
mother’s head in spite of all the mortgages in the world.
Oh! how I would work!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Brave lad, how I envy you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Envy me! Well, yes, I am a good deal happier than
one could expect. Working for women who love you isn’t
bad fun; but here is the gate, and there is Ruthy, you can
see her through the window. Won’t she wonder who it is,
and what brings me home this time of day?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You seem to have forgotten your hurt?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, it feels a little heavy, and smarts some; but I’ll
pull my cap down not to frighten them. Of course, it’s
nothing; but then one’s mother is so tender of a fellow.
There!”</p>

<p class='c006'>James pulled his cap far over his bruised forehead, and
opening the gate, invited his strange guest to pass in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE GENTLE INVALID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ruth Laurence though an invalid, was pining for
something which might occupy the slender hands which
seemed all too frail for labor. She could do many pretty
trifles, however, with those deft fingers, and in her soul lay a
deep love of art, which they were patiently striving to work
out, whenever a bit of wax or a scrap of paper fell in her way.
Sometimes, as the wind swept through the open windows of
that little room, it carried off tiny morsels of paper, on which
a butterfly, a bird, or a flower was sketched, which went
whirling off among the old-fashioned flowers like a living
thing. Sometimes Ruth would manage to get ravelings from
scraps of silk, out of which she wrought rose-buds for pincushions,
and groups of blossoms for segar-cases which
brought in a shilling or two, now and then, for the scanty
household-fund, and gave her a world of happiness in the
sweet power of creation.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was lying on her couch, close by the window, with a
bit of drawing paper in her hand, on which the soft shadows
of a white rose were forming themselves, when a click of the
gate-latch, and the sound of strange footsteps made her start
and look through the window. She saw her brother James
by the gate, and with him a tall man, whom she had
never seen before. The stranger waited a moment for the
boy to complete what he was saying, and then crossed the
little yard, while James ran forward to open the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ruthy! Ruthy, dear! just sit up a little, if you can; I
have brought a gentleman, who wants to get acquainted with
us. I told him all about things, you know, and he seems
to think—Well, I don’t know what he thinks—but something
awful kind, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>While James stood in the doorway uttering this exciting
little speech, Ruth arose feebly from her pillows, dropped her
feet to the floor, and turned her eyes upon the stranger in
breathless expectation. She saw a tall slender man, some
forty or forty-five years of age, with hair that had once
been black as the neck of a raven, large dark eyes full of
calm sadness, a forehead as white as marble, and but faintly
lined. To these were added a fine sensitive mouth, to
which laughter seemed to come never, and smiles but
seldom; still, in his face and quiet, gentlemanly air, was
that indescribable something which awakes sympathy and
verges on tenderness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive me, young lady; I did not intend to intrude on
you in this abrupt way,” he said, lifting his hat as he crossed
the threshold. “I have met a young lady, your sister, I
think, who half gave me permission to call.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My sister is not at home,” answered Ruth, blushing;
for she was so unaccustomed to the sight of a stranger that
the presence of this one set her heart into a wild flutter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know; this good lad told me as much. He also told
me some other things about his family, that made me think—that
made me hope—” The stranger paused, and bent
his eyes upon the girl with a long, wistful look, that seemed
pleading with her for help.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps you hoped to find some one that you knew?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes; I did hope that—but it was long ago. No
friend of mine could be young as you are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was it somebody you wanted to find, then? Perhaps
mother may help you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps,” said the man, abstractedly, still gazing in
that delicate young face, as if searching its features, one by
one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She knew all my poor father’s friends,” said Ruth,
embarrassed by the silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, yes! I should like to see your mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Ruth lifted her voice a little, and called out:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother! Mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I must be going. It’s so long since I went out,
and they’ll miss me at the store,” said little James, who had
waited in silence for something strange to happen; for this
advent of a stranger seemed full of importance to him.
“Good-bye, Ruthy; good-bye, sir! I’m off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As James ran down the front yard, Mrs. Laurence came
into the little parlor, untying the apron in which she had
been working as she came in. Mr. Ross started, and turning
in his chair, regarded her with a sharp, scrutinizing
look, which deepened into an expression of keen disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is my mother,” said Ruth, bending her head, while
Mrs. Laurence paused to fling her apron back into the kitchen,
when she saw a stranger in the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross arose, and stood a moment, waiting for Mrs. Laurence
to advance; for, though everything was humble, and
even poverty-stricken around them, he felt that these
women were naturally far above the level of their appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have intruded, Madam, perhaps rudely,” he said, at
last; “but having met one of your children by accident,
her resemblance to one—to an old friend—was so striking,
that I ventured to inquire about her here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence seemed more than usually disturbed by
this speech; she turned a cold glance on her visitor, and
said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot remember of ever seeing you before, sir; there
must be some mistake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross looked searchingly at the woman, as she spoke; her
voice was firm and somewhat harsh; her reception of his
polite address a little repellant; but she motioned him to
take a seat, and occupied one herself, putting down her
sleeves, which had been rolled up to the elbows.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“I once knew a man of your name,” said Ross, regarding
the woman with a look of hesitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was he a policeman?” questioned Mrs. Laurence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not while I knew him. We were boys in the same
school.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How long was that ago?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than twenty years—that is, it is almost that since
we parted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence reflected a moment, then lifting her face,
said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He was the dearest friend I ever had. When I left him,
he promised to watch over my interests, to——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I ask your name,” said Mrs. Laurence now keenly
aroused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ross—Herman Ross.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence turned her eyes from the face she had
been studying with a sort of terror, and her voice grew low
and hoarse as she questioned him further.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the name of your friend—his full name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leonard—Leonard Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was father’s name,” said Ruth, in a half whisper,
looking at her mother, who groaned heavily, without saying
a word. Low as the words were spoken, Ross heard them,
and his face kindled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, young lady, your father was my close friend, and
loved me like a brother. Will you not trust and like me a
little for his sake?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love everything that he loved,” said Ruth, with tears
in her eyes; and she held out her frail little hand, which
Ross took, reverently; then he turned to the other woman
with a look of touching appeal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you are Leonard Laurence’s wife. I remember
seeing you once, a fair, young bride.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The iron muscles about the woman’s mouth began to
quiver, and a flush came around her pale-blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“There is a long weary stretch between now and then,”
she said, turning away her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is, indeed!” responded Ross, with a sigh, which
stirred his bosom with the force of a groan. “A long, weary
stretch; full of desolation to more than you and me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It gave him a violent death, and me widowhood like
this,” said the woman, turning cold and white.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The boy told me something of this, but I was not sure
it was the same man. I hoped to find him alive and prosperous.
This is a hard, hard blow to a man who had so few
friends.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman looked at him jealously, as if his evident
grief encroached upon her own melancholy right of sorrow.
From the first, she seemed to regard him as a person to be
kept at arms-length.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me more—tell me how he died?” said Ross, in a
tremulous voice. “It will be a pain, I know; but this suspense
and conjecture will have no end, without a thorough
knowledge of all that relates to him. I must know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth looked wistfully at her mother, and was about to
utter some tender protest; but Mrs. Laurence lifted her
hand, as if she understood the kind impulse, and was ready
to take up her hard task.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE POLICEMAN’S DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“It was during the Rebellion,” said Mrs. Laurence,
“when the laboring-classes of the city went wild with a mad
idea that the draft was intended to oppress them and favor the
rich. Most of our city troops had been drawn off to check
the advance of the enemy, and a fearful duty fell upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>police—as brave a set of men as ever went to any battlefield.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The riot came upon us unexpectedly. My husband
seemed rather more than usually anxious that morning,
but not really apprehensive. He was then a captain in
the force, and held to be one of the bravest and most experienced
men among them. You have seen him. You know
what manner of man he was; but, no—you knew him in
his youth—this was in his perfect prime. In the glow of
health, in the might of firm resolution, he left me that day.
I watched him going down the street, from that window—that
very window, sir. We had just built this house, then,
and were making it a home for the children. The youngest
was by my side; he had mounted a chair, and was clapping
his hands and shouting for his father to look back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leonard was anxious, and walked on swiftly; for
strange noises were in the air, while groups of men and
women gathered in the street, suddenly, as if they sprang
out of the earth. Still, my husband heard the shouts of
his child, and turning, waved his hand to us. I saw that
no smile lighted his face. He stopped, and seemed to listen.
A low howl swept up the street, as if a den of wild beasts
were clamoring for food. This time, he waved his club, and
plunged into a great crowd of people, that choked up the
street, menacing him with threats. That great heaving
crowd poured itself upon him and tossed him into its
midst with shouts that made me quake from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was an awful day. He had left me in charge of
our children, and I dared not leave them for a moment. My
home was in the very heart of a disaffected district. My
husband was obnoxious, from his strict discharge of duty,
and suspected of more education, and higher ambition, than
the horde that surrounded us. Lonely as our household
was, danger menaced us. Twice during the day a crowd
came up the street, swarmed into our little garden, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>threatened to burn the house. They would have done it,
too, but for Eva, who flung the door open, and standing
on the threshold, told them that she was there to protect
her mother and two children, younger and weaker than
herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, sir! if you could have seen that child standing
there, and braving that crowd of fiends! How beautiful
she looked, with her coal black hair all abroad; her great
eyes burning with courageous fire, hurling words of wild
appeal, like bullets, into the crowd. They met her, first,
with groans of derision, then with fierce shouts of applause,
swearing that she was worthy to lead in their own hot work;
worthy of a place by the demoniac women who knew how to
cut their way through fire and blood to the heart of an aristocrat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before I could reach my child, or even cry out, a gaunt,
gray-headed old woman, with blazing eyes, and lips blistered
with oaths, seized her by the arm, shouting,</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes, yes! let us set her on to help us! She shall tear
the brats from out of their silk nests in the avenue, up
yonder, and drown them in the gutters! This is fancy
work; just fit for a daring imp that isn’t afraid of <i>us</i>!
Them who ain’t afeared to fight us are bound to lead us.
We want a girl, about her age, to hunt up the small fry,
and fling them down for us to trample in the mud.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the woman spoke, she lifted Eva from her feet, and
would have hurled her into the crowd; but I pushed the
children from me, and sprang upon her with the strength
of a strong man in my arms. The struggle was short and
fierce. I rescued Eva, and thrusting her behind me, took
her place on the threshold of our home. The woman
sprang upon me like a fiend; froth flew like snow-flakes
from her writhing lips, and a glow of blood burned in her
eyes—but I had three children to save.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How I saved them; what words were used; if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>strength of desperation, that fairly turned every nerve in
my body to iron, was put forth at all, I do not know; but
the crowd broke, filling the air with shouts of laughter, and
surged away, dragging that fiend-woman with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I bolted the doors, and fell down, weaker and
more helpless than the children who crept around me, too
frightened for crying. All day long, the howling of the
mob, the shrieks of terrified negroes, and the rush of crowds,
sweeping by on some errand of destruction, filled us with
shuddering dread. When night came we were still alone,
watchful and trembling with unutterable fear. I did not
think it strange that my husband was absent. While there
was a duty to perform, I knew that we need not hope to see
him. But, oh, the suspense was terrible!</p>

<p class='c006'>“All night we waited and listened to the gathering
storm, to the howlings of the mob, the startling crash of
fire-bells, following close on each other, and the sharp
shrieks of men and women, trampled under foot by the
merciless rioters, whose fury it was my husband’s duty to
quell. Oh, that was an awful night! At each sound my
children would creep closer to me, and while the heart
quivered in my bosom, I tried to comfort them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Toward morning, a messenger came from my husband.
He was still at his post, and might not be able to leave it
that day. We must keep bravely up, and remain quiet,
otherwise his mind would be so distracted that it might be
hard to go through what lay before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I learned from the messenger that Leonard had tasted
no food since morning, and hastily gathered up what there
was cooked in the house. I sent it to him with the children’s
love. Of course, we would be brave and quiet, I
said. He must not care for us. I would mind the children,
if God would only take care of him. I said this bravely,
but my heart quailed within me as I spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The messenger promised to come back in an hour or two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and we waited for him with growing terror, for the crash of
the fire-bells was perpetual now. All around us, red
tongues of flame were shooting up through burning roofs,
and the streets were full of straggling rioters, with the
plunder of sacked homes on their backs; some of them
reeling with intoxication, and cursing everything they met,
as men and women cursed each other around the guillotines
of Paris, and in the slaughter of the communes. These
sights kept me at the window. An awful fascination drew
me toward the street whenever a fresh mob came crowding
along it. How did I know that he might not be there
struggling against the stormy passions that filled the city
with smoke and thunder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The sun was going down on the second day, and there
we stood, carefully holding back the window-curtain, and
straining our eyes to catch the first glimpse of his coming,
or of some messenger who could tell us of his safety. All
at once, a sound of low, growling thunder rolled down one
of the cross-streets, and before we could tell what it meant,
a group of policemen came up the street, each man armed
and resolute, but white as marble, with a knowledge of the
fearful odds against them. The leader of these men, towering
above them all, was my husband. He never once looked
toward the house. Perhaps he feared that the sight of it
would unman him. With a loud, ringing voice, that reached
us where we stood, he gave some orders to his men, who
ranged themselves across the street, from which danger
threatened. In a moment they were swept back by a throng
of rioters—swept back and scattered by a rush of overpowering
numbers. A shot was fired, and one man fell—the
tallest, the grandest. Oh, God, help me!—the bravest
of them all. I saw him go down. I saw the mob trample
over him with yells of rage. His groans, his death-agony
are unheeded as the stones under those brutal feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never knew how it was done, but in a moment I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>struggling and buffeting my way through that avalanche
of human fiends, as drowning men fight with the surging
waters of a flood. Perhaps they had some compassion; or,
it may be, that my white face frightened them, for the crowd
broke where he was lying, and scattered away, tracking his
blood upon the pavement as they went. I fell down on my
knees by his side. I laid my hand on his heart, and drew
it away wet and red. His eyes were open; but they could
not see his poor wife; his lips were parted beneath the
shadow of his beard, which the wind stirred, and it seemed
to me that he was speaking. But, no; his murderers
had done their work well. I knelt down upon those hot,
dusty stones and covered my face, that they might not look
upon the agony of my grief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva had followed me, and the little ones had clung to
her shivering and crying as she pressed through the crowd.
We were all together—his little family, wife and children—but
he was dead. They would not believe it, but called
upon him with feeble cries to look up and say that he was
not much hurt. I knew that he was dead; that they were
orphans, and <i>I</i>, his wife, a widow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>ARTIST SYMPATHY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The woman ceased speaking. During her whole narrative
she had shed no tears, but her voice was low and cold,
like the air that comes from a tomb. Her lips never quivered,
but they grew white as death. While her mother
was talking, Ruth had partly risen and drew the window-curtains
softly together, hoping thus to shroud something
of the grief which this man had so painfully aroused.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Then she sunk back upon her couch, and looked at the
stranger reproachfully through her tears. Mr. Ross sat
gazing upon the floor, with trouble in his eyes. He felt
all the pain he had given, and the thought was full of
distress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, at last. “I knew Laurence well. He
was brave, noble, well educated. How comes it that he
took a position which proved so fatal to him and to you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He could get nothing better to do,” said Mrs. Laurence,
drearily, “and I had no power to help him. But for the
children, I might have obtained my old position as a
teacher; but they needed all my care. At first, he did not
intend to remain in the police, but time reconciled us to it,
and he would soon have laid up enough capital for a start in
business. It is all gone now; for I would not let the children
go out into the world without education, and they
loved study.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can easily believe that,” said Ross, glancing at Ruth,
who still kept her position, with tears trembling on her
eyelashes—a delicate, fair girl, with the refinement of a
cultivated intellect in every feature. “At least you are
blessed in the children my friend loved so well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are good children,” answered the woman, wearily;
for the excitement of her narrative had left her cold and
weak. Still, the stranger looked as if something was unexplained.
He moved across the room, and in a vague way
took up the bit of drawing-paper, on which Ruth had sketched
her white roses. The delicacy of the touch, and free unfolding
of the buds, seemed to arrest his thoughts, and turn
them into another channel. His eyes brightened, and
bending them upon Ruth, he asked her if she had ever attempted
anything in oils.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth blushed and casting her eyes down, that he might
not remark the longing wish that spoke there, answered,
“No; it had been impossible.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>He seemed to understand the craving wish that had
never yet been expressed, and after a moment’s hesitation,
observed,</p>

<p class='c006'>“I sometimes paint a little.” Then, after hesitating a
minute, he added, “There must be an upper room in your
house which would give sufficient light.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered Ruth, vaguely comprehending his idea.
“But mother was in hopes of letting that, if she could find
a nice person.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The flash of a kindly thought came into those dark eyes,
and Ross seemed about to speak; but he checked himself,
looked at the sketch again, and laid it down.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is your sister anything of an artist?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva can do almost anything!” said Ruth, and
her face brightened out of its mournful look.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is older than you, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Older? Oh, yes! And a thousand times brighter than
I ever shall be. But, then, there is no one like our Eva.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is, indeed, a bright, beautiful creature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Everybody thinks that of her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man looked earnestly at Ruth. Some thought was
in his mind which he did not know how to express. The
girl before him was very lovely, but part of this arose from
that exquisite fairness, which exclusion from the sun and
frail health had imparted, and was in extreme contrast with
the dark, rich beauty of her sister. Ruth read something
of this thought in the man’s face and answered it, smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, everybody wonders that we are so unlike; but that
is in all respects. She is strong, cheerful, splendid, while I—Oh,
Sir! you can see how different I am.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can see that you are doing yourself injustice,” said
Ross, taking his hat. “But excuse me, that I have intruded
so long, as your father’s old friend. You must let me
come again. I may be of some service.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence bent her head, and her visitor departed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. CARTER MAKES A VISIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Mother! mother! come here!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth lifted her sweet voice a little, and spoke with some
excitement, for she was taken quite by surprise by the appearance
of a magnificent carriage before the gate; a carriage
that seemed half made of translucent glass. Two pretentious
menials in livery sat between the glittering lamps
on each side the coachman’s seat, and a pair of chestnut
horses arched their necks, tossed their heads, and made their
gold-mounted harness rattle again with their proud, impatient
movements, while one of those solemn personages let
himself to the ground and opened the carriage-door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is the place, ma’am. It doesn’t seem possible, but
this <i>is</i> the place. I only hope Battles will be able to hold
the hosses; but they don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just stand aside, keep my dress from the wheels, and
mind your own business, Jacob,” said Mrs. Carter, with an
imperious wave of her hand, as she rolled herself through
the door of the carriage, and lighted heavily on the pavement.
“If I know myself intimately you were hired to
open doors, and shut your own mouth. So this is the place,
is it? And a lovely place it is! Quite a rustic cottage!
There, now you may open the gate!”</p>

<p class='c006'>While she was delivering this reprimand to her servant,
Mrs. Carter shook out her flounces, drew the lace shawl
more jauntily over her shoulder, and swept through the
gate with all the magnificence and glory of an empress
about to honor some subject by her presence. Half way up
the path she remembered what was due to herself, and
stepped back into a flower-bed, waving Jacob forward with
her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The tall footman cast a look of unutterable disgust at his
fellow-servant on the box, and, striding up the path, gave a
pull at the humble little bell that filled the whole house
with its tinkling. Mrs. Laurence came to the door, grim
and gaunt, but neat in her dress, and composed in manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does Mrs. Laurence live here?” inquired the tall footman,
striking his gloves together, as if the bell-handle had
left offensive dust on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am Mrs. Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, indeed! This is the lady, marum.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter came forward, smiling blandly, and holding
out her straw-colored glove with an air of sublime condescension.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence took the tightly-gloved hand stiffly enough,
and let it fall from her clasp without a smile. She had suffered,
this poor widow, and smiles did not come easily to her
face; but if cold, she was well-bred, and stood aside that
her strange guest might enter the little passage-way, and
pass through the open parlor-door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How cozy—how exquisite!” exclaimed Mrs. Carter,
glancing around at the snow white muslin curtains and the
neat furniture, which would have been poverty-stricken in
other houses. “No wonder my dear brother was so charmed.
‘Such a contrast!’ he said, when he found me in my
‘boudoir bower chamber,’ he says, they used to call it, in
old times. ‘Such a contrast,’ says he, ‘between you and
them—between this and that! You with everything grand
and sumptuous; they nothing but taste—pure, aesthetic
taste! Their little room is a bijou!’ Just as I find it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter seated herself as she spoke, and turned her
full-blown, smiling face on Ruth, who answered her appeal
with a look of gentle welcome; while her mother stood by,
evidently waiting to learn why her humble home had been
so grandly invaded.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter observed this, and waved her hand benignly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Sit down! sit down, Mrs. Laurence; have no hesitation
about it. I have been a poor woman myself; so, never
mind the apron, but sit down. My call is for you as well
as the young people!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence took a seat near the door, and muttered
something about being “a hard-working woman,” which
Mrs. Carter took up at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Hard-working!’ Don’t mention it, my dear madam!
Your little housework here is nothing to what I have thrown
upon me. What with receptions, shopping, promiscuous
calls, regulating servants, the torment of dress-makers,
and entertaining Carter’s friends, I am just worn out.
Sometimes I think the happiest time of a woman’s life is
when she lives in two rooms, and carries her baby about on
one arm, while she does her work with the other!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still,” said Ruth, with a quiet smile, “we seldom find
ladies willing to give up prosperity and go back to that
life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, n—no!” answered Mrs. Carter, glancing through
the window at her two servants perched high upon the carriage,
and softly pluming herself under the thought of all
they represented, “one can’t quite expect that. When a dog
gets his day he likes to keep it, of course. Besides, it’s awful
hard to come down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Laurence, in her dull, low tone, “it is
hard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But this young lady is not all your family? My brother
spoke of another.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is Eva,” said Ruth, with animation. “She is busy
in the day-time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes!—now I remember: of course, she could not
be here now. An awful bright girl. I saw her once: pretty
as a pictur! took a fancy to the turn of her head. My!
how she does carry off a shawl! That girl is what I call
superb!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“She is good!” said Mrs. Laurence, with hard emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, good as gold, I haven’t no doubt,” chimed in Mrs.
Carter. “That is why I have called. ‘That girl is a born
lady,’ says I to Carter, when we were making out a list of invitations
for my great party, ‘and I am bound to have her
come.’ So here is the invitation! Brought it myself, because
brother Ross said a call was necessary, and I want to do
everything <i><span lang="fr">comme il fou</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter took a squarely-folded envelope from
her pocket, on which was a flaming monogram in red and
gold, which she held out to Mrs. Laurence, who took it gingerly,
as if she feared the fiery letters would burn her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If this young lady ever goes out, I have another for
her,” said the visitor, beaming with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never do,” said Ruth, with a faint quiver of pain in
her voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Spine?” questioned her visitor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth bent her head a little from the pillow, and a look of
sadness came into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t look down-hearted about it, my dear; you’ll soon
get about again. I feel sure that I’ve got a receipt for
spine complaint somewhere, and I’ll send it to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth smiled very mournfully, but thanked her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s you, I suppose, that’s beginning to make picters.
Ross told me about it, and I promised to have some done for
my boudoir. Those I have cost ever-so-much, but he don’t
seem to like ’em. ‘Something small and delicate,’ he
says; such as you can do beautifully if I’ll only give you
time—which I’m bound to do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The warm, pure blood flashed over that gentle face, and
Ruth half rose from her pillow in overwhelming surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do not mean it! Did the gentleman in truth think
anything of the little things I sent to him. He asked me,
or I would not have dared.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Think anything!’ Of course he did; ‘gems,’ he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>‘they would be, with a little touching-up,’ which he meant
to show you about. Though how a bit of canvas can be
turned into ‘gems,’—which are rubys, and diamonds, and
such like, I take it, beats me. But that was what he said;
and where picters is concerned, Ross aint to be disputed, let
me tell you. It was all I could do to keep him from turning
half of my picters out of doors; though mercy knows the
frames alone cost Carter enough to break a common man;
for we bought such as took up the most gold, meaning to
have enough for our money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth lay on her couch while the woman was speaking,
lost in a soft glow of gratitude. The one dream of her life
gave promise of realization. How diligently she had
worked out the little knowledge of drawing and color, which
had been a part of her education, when she was able to
study, and before the great affliction fell upon her. How
much thought she had given, how earnestly she had toiled
when this one pursuit became the passion and forlorn hope of
her life. Oh, it was heavenly! God had given some power
even to her! Those delicate fingers which she clasped over
her bosom in a sudden rush of gratitude, had the subtle
craft of creating beautiful objects, which, in their turn,
melted into gold. Could this be? Was the woman yonder
with all that flutter of lace and fringe about her, a reality?</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl lifted herself slowly from her cushions, and
looked around the room. Mrs. Laurence had left it. Something
in the kitchen required her presence, and she was
getting restive under the infliction of that kind-hearted
woman’s conversation; so she had glided out like a shadow,
scarcely caring whether she was missed or not.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='large'>THE FIRST BANK NOTES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“She has gone—mother, I mean,” said Ruth, troubled
with a fear that their visitor might be offended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter turned her head with a little disdainful toss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I see. Not very good manners; but to be expected.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother is so much alone, she sometimes forgets.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think as much. But that is neither here nor
there. If old women choose to cut up rusty they are welcome,
for anything I care. But we were talking about the
picters for my boudoir. How long will it take you to paint
em?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you were really in earnest? You meant it?”
cried Ruth, catching her breath, and clasping her hands in
an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Meant it? Of course I did. Ross has just ripped every
one of my picters off of the wall, and says they aint worth
the frames, which are lovely, Miss; and I’m sure the paintings
were just as bright as red, and green, and yellow could
make them. But, hoity-toity! my gentleman just pitched
them into the coach-house; and I solemnly believe they are
hung up in Battle’s room this minute. ‘Now,’ says he, ‘fill
them empty frames with something worth looking at.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“But where are they coming from?” says I, huffy as
could be, for I didn’t like them empty frames lyin’ in a heap
on the floor. Then he brought down two or three of the
things,—‘rough gems’ he called ’em,—that you had sent to
him, and put them in the frames. I aint no judge perhaps,—so
don’t be offended!—but, really, now, they did not make
half the show that the others did; but he said, there was
‘downright genius in them,’ and I gave in about it. So, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>you could come to my house,—which, of course, you can’t—them
four picters are all you would see in my boudoir,
instead of them he had turned out of doors. “Now, my
dear, how much am I to pay you for them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How—how much? Oh, madam, I—I——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Ruth put both hands to her face, and burst into a
passion of warm, sweet tears, that shook her slight frame
from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, now, I never did,” said Mrs. Carter, half starting
from her seat. “He thought you would be delighted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And so I am—the happiest, happiest creature that ever
lived. Oh, madam, you seem to me like an angel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter lifted her head and plumed herself like a
peacock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure I don’t pretend to anything of that sort, being
just a trifle stout, and not given to flying. But if you like
to think so, and it makes you happy, I wont disturb the idea,
because it reminds me of things Carter used to say years
and years ago, when we first went to housekeeping in two
rooms, with a closet in the cellar for wood and coal. Then—then——”</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, even to her own astonishment, the woman
broke down, her eyes filled with tears, and her bosom heaved
with sobs. Impatient with herself, she snatched a handkerchief
from her pocket, and swept its rich lace across the redness
of her eyes, and gave out a gurgling, hysterical laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder what’s come over me,” she said, at last, shaking
out her moist handkerchief. “There is no telling about
me. Carter says I always was a sensitive cretur. Well, Miss
Laurence, we were speaking about them pictures. How
much now? Ross thought that twenty-five dollars apiece
would be little enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Twenty-five dollars!” exclaimed Ruth, and her large
eyes widened like those of an astonished child. “Oh, madam
you cannot mean it!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“What! you don’t think it enough? Well, say thirty;
though I have seen pictures twice their size sell for less.
Will thirty satisfy you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, madam, I know you are too kind for that but it
seems as if you were mocking me. The amount you mentioned
first, is so much that I can scarcely believe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor girl really could not comprehend her good
fortune; she trembled all over. Her great eyes were bent
on Mrs. Carter with pleading entreaty, that this cruel, cruel
trifling might cease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter could not understand all this, but had a
vague idea that the price she offered was satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” she said, drawing a reticule-purse from her
pocket by its gold chains, and taking from that a roll of
money, “if you are content with twenty-five, I don’t mind
throwing in a trifle, so we will make it thirty. There it is—six
twenties; and I must say, it does me good to pay it
over. Just roll it up, and buy yourself something nice
with it. There! there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter came close to Ruth, and bent over her with
the money fluttering from her gloved fingers. Instead of
receiving it with smiles, as the good woman expected, the
young creature, half rose from her cushions, wound both
arms around that short neck, and kissed the smiling face
with a passionate outburst of gratitude, which awoke all the
warm genial womanhood of Mrs. Carter’s nature into active
life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, why, dear child! what have I done, that you
should smother me with kisses, and hold on to me as if—as
if you were my own child, as I wish from the bottom
of my heart you were?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, madam, you are so good. You have made me the
happiest creature that ever lived,” cried Ruth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there, don’t set me off again,” said Mrs. Carter,
patting both those trembling little hands with her own.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“Does a little money make you so happy? Well, just at
first, I remember, it does. But then one gets used to it.
By-and-by you won’t care. Come, now, put up your money,
and the next picture will be worth more. Ross is going to
show you how to touch ’em up; and he can do it, if any
one can, for he belongs to some great pictur academy across
the seas, and is A. number one at painting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In a soft, motherly fashion, Mrs. Carter laid the young
girl back upon her couch, and began smoothing her beautiful
hair. In the fullness of her content, she answered
back with broad sympathy the smiles that came around
those parted lips, and the look of ineffable happiness that
filled those dove-like eyes, with something more beautiful
than sunshine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true! it is real! and I <i>am</i> good for something!”
murmured Ruth, holding the money up that she might feast
her eyes upon it. “Oh, madam! God sent you here! I
was weak and helpless; while others worked, I could only
pray. See how the blessed Lord has answered me! I
know it is not my poor little pictures, but your goodness
that has done this—my prayers and your goodness!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are just a lovely little darling, anyhow; but here is
some one coming. There, now, we are ready.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter gathered up the floating notes, crushed them
into a ball, and hid them under the pillow of the couch.
Then she wiped Ruth’s eyes with her cobweb handkerchief,
passed it over her own wet lashes, and called out, “Come
in!” as a vigorous knock sounded from the front door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>OLD FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The door of the little parlor opened, and Mrs. Smith
stood in the passage. From her place behind the counter
she had seen the splendor of that carriage before Mrs. Laurence’s
gate, and could stand the cravings of her curiosity
no longer. She had held herself as a sort of proprietor of
the Laurence family after that famous supper, and felt that
any visitor who stopped at that little gate was a guest for
herself. At first she rather hesitated to put in her claim;
but when a half hour, then an hour went by, and that glittering
mass of black and gold still kept its place, the position
became tantalizing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving Boyce behind the counter, the good woman tied
on her best bonnet, flung a shawl over her broad shoulders,
and made her way down the street, burning with curiosity,
and just a little jealous that so much distinction had come
to her friend, in which she had no part. Standing there
in the entry-way, she hesitated, overpowered by a first
glance of the richly-dressed lady who seemed to fill up the
little parlor with the splendor of her presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter had hastily put on her company manners, and
sat in state, fanning herself with her still moist handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, Mrs. Smith started forward, her eyes glistening,
and her shawl floating away from the grasp of her
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Carter! Well, I never did——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Smith! Is this you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>For the moment, both women were natural. Mrs. Carter
forgot herself and her finery in the honest delight of
meeting an old friend. Mrs. Smith, a little dazzled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>bewildered, came forward with both arms held out, and would
have embraced her former crony, but for a sudden consciousness
of the silks, and laces, and heavy gold bracelets with
which the latter was metamorphosed. This brought the
arms slowly down to her side, and left her lips, from which
the broad smile was vanishing, half apart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter broke into a mellow laugh, and held out both
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you didn’t more’n half know me, Mrs. Smith? No
wonder! Sometimes I don’t know myself. But how do
you do? How are the children and Smith? Is he stout
and jolly as ever?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith remembered that she had been cutting cheese
just before she left the grocery, and wiped one hand on
the corner of her shawl before she gave it into the clasp of
those straw-colored gloves, smiling gingerly, as if she were
afraid of hurting them. But Mrs. Carter was herself that
day; a breath of secret human sympathy had swept the
chaff from her really good heart, and, for the time, her magnificence
was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, now,” said Mrs. Smith, recovering herself under
this hearty treatment. “It’s good for weak eyes to see you
again, Mrs. Carter; I went around to the old house, nigh on
to a year ago, and inquired about you, but they said you
had moved away no one knew where; so I gave you up for
a bad job.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A bad job, ha! Well, I wonder what Carter would
say? <i>He</i> don’t think it a bad job, you bet! Just look out
there, Smith, and tell me what you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith leaned toward the window, and took in a view
of the carriage, with the two men sitting impatiently in the
coachman’s seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you really mean that, Mrs. Carter?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That, and an open carriage, besides a couper for Carter,
and two saddle-horses, in case Carter and I might want to
take lessons and ride in the Park together.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“But how, Mrs. Carter, how?” inquired Mrs. Smith,
open-mouthed with wonder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know Carter got into the feed-business; that led
him to hosses and mules, and sich. Well, the army wanted
hosses; Carter went in under contract. Then the hosses
wanted feed, he went in under contract again. Then he
got into produce, which kept a running up and down, for
ever so long; there he made and made, keeping his eye-teeth
sharp, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mercy on me! You take away my breath, Mrs.
Carter!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No wonder; it took mine away more than once. After
this, he hooked in with a clothing-house, and that was the
best of all. Everything substantial but the clothes. Well,
these things rolled up, and this is just what it has come to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter spread her two hands, and rustled her
garments with a jovial laugh, while her old friend stepped
back and surveyed her from head to foot, with glowing
admiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you don’t seem a bit different,” she broke forth at
length.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter flushed red, and drew the lace shawl about
her with emphatic protest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think so, Mrs. Smith; but others are of a different
opinion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith, for the first time, felt rebuffed, and answered,
meekly,</p>

<p class='c006'>“You were asking about Smith. He’s been a-doing very
well—very well, indeed; in the grocery line, though. You
can see our store from the front yard here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter leaned out of the window, and took a survey
of her friend’s place of business, which had a respectable
show of prosperity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That looks like living,” she said; “and I’m right down
glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“We live over the store, snug and comfortable,” answered
Mrs. Smith, highly pleased.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Children all alive?” inquired Mrs. Carter, with hesitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alive and hearty, thank goodness!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter heaved a deep sigh. “Smith,” she said, “I
should like to take a look at your young ones. I’m not
used to seeing children, in these days, crowding the doors
by dozens, as they did in our old neighborhood, where Smith
and Carter were such friends, and you and I—— Well,
never mind about that. I haven’t forgotten it. Wait a
minute, I’m going home with you. Good-bye, little girl.
Don’t she look like a lily, lying there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s got a lovely color,” answered Mrs. Smith. “I
never saw the like of it on her cheek before. But where is
Mrs. Laurence? Always at work? Mrs. Laurence, I say!
My friend, Mrs. Carter, is going.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence came into the room, stiff and cold as marble.
The softening effects of her illness had worn off, and
so had the little gleam of sunshine, brought to her door by
the kind woman who was calling her from the kitchen, to
which she had retreated the moment Mrs. Carter became
interested in Ruth; thus she was entirely ignorant of the
event which had so suddenly lifted the invalid into Paradise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had something to do,” she said, by way of grim apology,
as Mrs. Carter held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind that! I know what it is to do my own
work—don’t I, Smith?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should rather think so,” answered Mrs. Smith, glowing
with intense satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With regard to the young lady, of course, we shall
expect her. I will send the carriage round, and Ross shall
come with it. Be sure that she is ready. He has set his
heart upon it, and so have I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence muttered something about being hard-working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>people, and quite out of such things; but Ruth
interposed, and made confident by the money under her
pillow lifted her radiant face, and said, with, a thrill of
triumph in her voice,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, mother, dear! Eva will go. She will like it.
Please do not refuse till we have talked it over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right! I leave it all with you, my pretty darling;
so, good-day; I mean to call again, very soon. Come,
Mrs. Smith, we’ll drive round the block, and see how you
like it,” said Mrs. Carter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>MR. BATTLES IS DISGUSTED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Smith settled her shawl with great anxiety, and
going up to the little mirror, smoothed out the bows of her
bonnet-strings, which certainly appeared all the better for
it. Then the two old friends went out together, and the tall
footman came down from his seat with a thunder-cloud on
his august brow, and opened the carriage-door with a protest
in every gesture. At this Mrs. Carter chuckled inwardly,
and gave Mrs. Smith the seat of honor. She, good
soul, drew a deep, deep breath, as her calico-dress came into
contact with the bright silken cushions, and sat bolt upright,
as if afraid that their yielding springs would swallow
her up, and leave Jerusha Maria an orphan.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me, how it gives!” she said, casting a half frightened
look at her old friend, who laughed with glee, and
leaned back in her own luxurious corner triumphing greatly
while the carriage moved on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ride was brief but glorious. Seldom did a turn out
of that description come within blocks and blocks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>corner grocery. Mrs. Smith had the satisfaction of knowing
that every window, which bore upon that point, was occupied
when she came through the carriage-door and swept
into her husband’s place of business, side by side with that
gorgeously-dressed lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce, who was behind the counter, posed himself at once
for an unlimited order; but Mrs. Smith passed him by with
a wave of the hand, and led the way up stairs to her own
apartment, where Kate Gorman was busy frying ham for
dinner, and James Laurence was carrying Jerusha Maria
in his arms, trying to hush her into silence, by bending his
head and giving her tiny hands unlimited control of his
hair, which was always a resource on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our last,” said Mrs. Smith, taking the child into her
motherly arms, and jerking down its long frock with one
hand, as she presented the young lady. Jerusha Maria took
a firm grip on her mother’s shawl, and being thus fortified
began staring at the stranger with all her might; finally,
she broke into a smile, as a watch, set thick with diamonds,
went swinging to and fro before her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give me a kiss now, and you shall hear it tick,” said
Mrs. Carter, gathering the child to her own bosom, and
throwing the watch-chain over its neck, where it fell in
glittering links adown the long frock. “Give me another;
there now, take it in your teanty, tointy little hands. Smith,
this is splendid! Such a weight! Oh, you little rogue, biting
at the diamonds, ha? If you were only mine, I’d
feed you with ’em!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter dropped into a Boston rocking-chair,
and laying the child’s face close to her bosom, began to sing,
and chirp, and kiss her into sleepiness. After this she still
cradled her lovingly in both arms and indulging in a word of
gossip, now and then, with the mother while her chair kept
in motion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That brother of yours—whatever became of him, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Carter? I remember how anxious you and Carter were.
How did he turn out?” inquired the mother, when Jerusha
Maria had dropped off. “Did you ever hear from him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That brother? Our Ross? Why, Smith, he’s back
again, the most perfect gentleman that you ever set eyes on.
You know I told you often how he was given to books,
studying night and day; how he painted picters, and
went into the country, every year, making sketches, as he
called it. Never was worth a cent for business; but so handsome,
and so wonderfully good! Well, he went off as you
know, and, somehow or another, got beyond seas, where
they think more of picters than we do, and made a wonderfully
great man of him; though not under the old name.
He took out a nom-de-something, as such people do, now and
then, and left off the last end of his name. So, instead of
Herman Ross Baker, we call him Herman Ross, which cuts
him loose from the old poverty-stricken life, for that makes
him shudder when you mention it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Proud, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; that isn’t it. He’s the last man on earth to be
ashamed of honest poverty. We are none of us mean
enough for that, high as we hold our heads among rich people.
But there is something that I don’t quite understand
about Ross.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A love-secret, I should not wonder!” said Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Mrs. Carter could answer that, Kate Gorman put
her head into the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dinner’s ready, and Mr. Smith not home yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith arose blushing and embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only ham and eggs,” she said; “but would you, just
for the sake of old times——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would I?” cried Mrs. Carter, huddling the baby into
it’s cradle, and taking off her gloves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Won’t I?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='large'>OVER THEIR TEA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Kate Gorman had received a hint from her mistress and
drawn the table out from against the wall, a trouble she seldom
undertook merely for the household. She also spread
a clean damask table-cloth over it, and gave her knives an
extra scour before she put them on the table. Then she
took particular pains with the ham, and left a fried egg
upon the top of each slice, with the unbroken yolk gleaming
like a ball of gold in the centre of the white, which
was beautifully browned on the edges.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these dainties she added a glass dish full of quince
preserves, and some nice green pickles, that contrasted gorgeously
with the gold of the egg and the red of the ham,
when they got on the same plate together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now this is something like,” said Mrs. Carter, pulling
off her canary-colored gloves with a succession of little
jerks, and seating herself at the table. “I haven’t set
down to such a dinner in years. The very sight of it is
enough to warm one’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” answered Mrs. Smith, “if I had only known you
were coming? but it is only a tea dinner. I feel quite
ashamed, and turkeys hanging in rows down stairs, with
cranberries by the bushel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, mercy on me! don’t think of it,—turkeys indeed!
I can get them every day of my life; but a bit of ham like
this, I shouldn’t dare to ask my cook for it. She’d sing out
shoddy, and quit the kitchen in less than no time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you really like it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really like it? I should think so,” answered Mrs.
Carter, feeling like a truant school girl as she balanced a
fragment of egg on the point of her knife, and gloried in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the vulgarity from the depths of her soul. “If you only
knew, Smith, what a comfort it is to eat just as you please,
and just what you please.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But don’t you?” questioned the hostess, holding her
own loaded knife half way to her mouth, and opening her
eyes wide.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear no! Why, Mrs. Smith, I should just as soon
think of jumping out of the window, as to ask for a plate
of corned beef and cabbage in my own house!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me, you don’t say so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The truth is, you’re expected to eat things that you
don’t know the name of, and turn against when you do.
There is patty de for grow, now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Patty what?” questioned Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p class='c006'>“De for grow!” answered Mrs. Carter, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith shook her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never heard the name before. One of your upper
crust friends, I suppose,” she said, in a bewildered way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, its only the livers of over-crammed geese; but
if you were to ask for gooseliver, the waiters would just
laugh in your face. They’ve done it, Mrs. Smith, done it
to me and Carter, too!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me,” said Mrs. Smith, in deep sympathy, “I
wouldn’t have believed it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! my dear, I sometimes think that Carter and I
enjoyed ourselves more when we first started life, then we
ever shall again—but, dear me, is that some one coming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only Smith. Of course you won’t mind him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not at all. Just another slice of the ham, its perfectly
delicious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Mr. Smith who had come up stairs and stopped in
the kitchen to wash his hands, which he did twice when
Kate Gorman told him of the guest inside. In fact, he
stepped into a closet and put on a clean collar and a pair of
cuffs, which Kate buttoned for him—first wiping her hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>on the dish towel and afterward on her own apron, in a sudden
paroxysm of neatness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” said the handmaiden, “yer fit to stand afore
the Queen; so just go in and take yer bit of dinner like a
gentleman, as ye are intirely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith took courage from this encomium, and entered the
next room fresh as cold water could make him, and shedding
around a wholesome flavor of yellow soap.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter sprang to her feet, and met her old neighbor
half way. “Why, Smith, <i>is</i> this you? Didn’t expect to
see me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, whether or know, I’m glad to see you. How’s
Carter?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter winced a little when her husband’s name was
thus mentioned shorn of its appendages; but she answered
cheerfully, and, seating herself at the table with a flutter
of lace and rustle of silks, commenced on her fresh relay
of ham with renewed appetite.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, Smith, this is what I call sociable,” she said,
looking around for a napkin; but not finding one, she used
her lace handkerchief instead. “Your wife and I have
been a-talking over old times; now its your turn.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith looked at the glittering silk of her dress, and heard
the tinkle of her gold chains and bracelets with something
like dismay. He was beginning to think the clean cuffs
and collar insufficient, and wished from the depths of his
heart that he had put on his best coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lovely weather, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Carter, feeling a
little innocent triumph in her old friend’s confusion, but
compassionating it all the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I don’t know—that is, it seemed to me this morning
that there was a slight indication of a storm,” answered
Smith, bringing out his very best language, in lieu of the
coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter accepted the long word as a compliment to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>her improved condition, and gently plumed herself upon it.
She would gladly have matched his elegance with corresponding
erudition, but failed to catch the inspiration, and
only said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed! well, I rather thought so myself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='large'>A SLIGHT ALTERCATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“My dear,” said Smith, looking around the table as if
he missed something, “have you nothing better than water
to offer Mrs. Carter, and this the first time she has honored
us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith looked around in some bewilderment, then
answered with a deprecatory glance at her friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The kettle was just boiling, and its likely that Kate
Gorman is drawing the tea now—Oolong of the very best.
Smith, you do not suppose I should offer Mrs. Carter anything
less?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Champagne,” answered Smith, throwing out his chest
with a swell of hospitable importance, “on ice and plenty
of it. I’m astonished at you, Mrs. Smith; that you did not
think of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I—I didn’t think; I didn’t know as you’d like us
to break into a basket,” cried Mrs. Smith, so eager to exculpate
herself, that she grew red in the face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if we didn’t break into baskets every day of our
lives,” answered the grocer, looking severely at his wife.
Then turning toward his guest, he observed that Mrs.
Smith, he was sorry to say, didn’t meet prosperity with
the air and grace that must make his friend Carter proud
of the wife he had married, who seemed capable of filling
any position.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Oh, Smith!” pleaded the hostess, with tears in her eyes,
“sometimes I think you don’t care how much you hurt my
feelings!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he don’t mean it,” interposed Mrs. Carter, “it’s
all because he wants to be hospitable.” Here the good
woman drew a deep breath and flushed happily, feeling
that she had at last matched her host in elaborate English.
“But there is no need of it. I’m just sick and tired of
champagne. A good cup of tea is worth a dozen bottles,
and here it comes steaming hot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that Britannia tea-pot, too,” muttered Smith, “as if
we had no silver in the house!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure the spoons are all here, they were counted only
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith, for secret reasons of his own, did not press the
question of silver, and a cry from the next room saved him
from the necessity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That child shrieking like mad again—upon my word,
Mrs. Smith, we must discharge the nurse. She is really
incompus—that is, incomp——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fortunately for the grocer, who never could have fought
his way through the word he was toiling at, Jerusha Maria
renewed her shrieks with appalling vigor, and Mrs. Smith
rushed into the next room.</p>

<p class='c006'>James had been doing his best to appease the infant’s
wrath, which had been kindled by his persistent refusal to
let her run her hand into the round holes which Kate Gorman
had left open in the stove, when she took the tea kettle
off.</p>

<p class='c006'>A dive into the red hot coals underneath had been ruthlessly
frustrated; hence the shrieks of rage which had
brought the mother into the midst of the fray. Goaded
out of her usual good-temper before, she flamed up furiously
now, snatching the young lady from the hold James was
striving desperately to keep upon her. Mrs. Smith turned
upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Do you want to kill the child before my eyes?” she
demanded, pulling down Jerusha Maria’s frock with a jerk,
“as if I hadn’t trouble enough without you setting in!”
Before the lad could answer, or attempt to defend himself,
Mrs. Smith sailed out of the room, smothering the
child’s wrath by a fiercer embrace than she was conscious of.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What <i>is</i> the matter?” cried Mrs. Carter, dropping her
knife and fork, “poor little darling! who has been ’busing
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Smith was rather disturbed by the cloud on his wife’s
face, and held out his arms in an abject, deprecating way;
but the indignant woman turned her back upon him, and
took her own chair, with majestic wrath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, Mr. Smith, I’m not that helpless that I can’t take
care of my own child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the tea. I thought you might——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Smith broke off the speech over which her
husband faltered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No I mightn’t; it won’t be the first time I’ve poured
out tea with a baby in my arms!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And a nice picter she makes,” said Mrs. Carter, “my
brother never sees a woman holding a baby like that but
he calls her a madonner at once. I only wish he could see
<i>her</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish he could—only when she’s a trifle more like
herself,” muttered Smith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith did not hear this cautious aside, but holding
Jerusha Maria on her left arm, poured out the tea with her
right hand, holding the Brittannia pot high up, and doing
the honors with a dash. Smith took this as defiance, and
withered under it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me, what is that?” exclaimed Mrs. Carter, listening
to a sound of suppressed sobs that came from the next
room. “Somebody crying, I do believe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith suspended the amber stream that was dashing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>into one of her best china cups, and listened. Sure
enough, suppressed sobs broke from the other room, that
smote her to the heart. She sat down the tea-pot, gathered
up Jerusha Maria, and went into the kitchen. There she
found James Laurence sitting on a chair, with both arms
flung out on the table, trying his very best to smother the
sound of his own uncontrollable mortification and grief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why! James, my boy; what are you crying about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The lad lifted up his head, and hurriedly wiped the tears
from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I wasn’t crying much!” he answered, choking back
his tears bravely. “Only—only I try so hard to do everything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know you do. There never was a better boy. Jerusha
Maria, the little darling, <i>is</i> aggravating sometimes.
What did she want then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only to put her two hands into the fire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You little tyke!” exclaimed the mother, giving a slight
shake and then an appeasing kiss to the child in her arms,
“and I was cross as fury because he wouldn’t let her do it.
There, there, James; never mind what I said. Of course
I didn’t mean it. You haven’t a better friend in the world
than I am.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that, how can I forget it? nothing else could
have brought me down to crying like a baby. The first
cross word brought all your goodness to me, and our people
right before me, and I felt like—like a wretch.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A wretch! you are nothing of the kind, Jimmy. Don’t
think that of yourself—and I haven’t been good to you a
bit more than you deserve. Here, now, take Jerusha Maria.
She wants to kiss you dreadfully. If she wants to put her
hands in the fire, you may—yes, just on this occasion, I
think you may shake her a little—not enough to make her
teeth chatter, though, because you see they are new and
tender yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I thought you would never trust her with me again,”
said James, holding out his arms and smiling, though his
thick eyelashes were still wet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Trust her with you! there, what does that seem like?”
cried Mrs. Smith, putting the child into those outstretched
arms, and patting both boy and child into harmony, while
her own angry passions gave place to a tender sort of
penitence, which extended even to Smith.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, James, take good care of her while I go in and
pour out the tea, for I’m afraid its getting cold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She did go in, beaming between tears and smiles, like an
April morning; and performed the honors of her table beautifully,
putting two lumps of sugar in her husband’s cup
with a shy look of concession, which did more to brighten
his face than the best bar soap had done.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>THE FIRST FRUITS OF GENIUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ruth Laurence kept her secret. An idea had entered
her head which she was resolved to carry out, unaided and
alone. At first she longed to tell her good fortune to her
mother; but Mrs. Laurence was never sympathetic or impulsive
enough to win that loving confidence which Ruth
longed to give. She had thought her own thoughts, and
suppressed her natural impulses so long, that this precious
secret became as gold to a miser, after she had dwelt upon
it, unspoken for a few hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing was certain: Eva should go to this party
dressed like the lady she was. Enough of the money under
her pillow should be used for that. Her own frail fingers
had earned this great happiness for her sister.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Tears came into those soft eyes as Ruth thought of it:
tender, sweet tears, such as the good and unselfish alone can
shed. She murmured to herself: “Yes, it shall be snow-white,
and fleecy as foam. I have the idea in my mind,
with a contrast—something brilliant and rich. Still, she
does not need that to make her the most beautiful of them
all. Dear Eva! what a surprise it will be! Here she comes,
looking <i>so</i> tired!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva came into the little parlor weary and sad; for the
duties of her position were frequently galling to the pride
of a high-spirited girl; and every hour some painful contrast
was forced upon her which disturbed her sense of
justice. While the family had been in absolute want, this
feeling was held in abeyance by all those active sympathies
that trample down minor causes of grief under great afflictions,
but now the proud nature of the girl asserted itself,
and strongly cynical and bitter feelings were rooting themselves
in her young heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva took off her bonnet, and, kneeling down by her
sister’s couch, kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Ruthy, how warm your cheek is! How your
arms cling to me! What is the matter? It seems like joy—but
how can that come here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A pleasant thing has happened, Eva, dear. You are
invited to a splendid party in the Fifth Avenue. Look
here!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva caught her breath. An invitation to her! She took
the square fold of paper, and, dazzled by the monogram,
began to examine it with that nervous curiosity which
makes so many people hesitate to learn the truth at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is from Mrs. Carter, the sister of that gentleman who
looked over my drawings. Such a cheerful, kind woman!
She brought it herself, that there might be no mistake, and
will send her own carriage for you. Isn’t it delightful?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, how I wish it possible!” exclaimed Eva, dropping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the invitation from her hand with a pang of absolute
despair. “That is what so many people were talking
about: all the customers were full of it. I think Mr.
Harold has an invitation. But it is of no use; I wish she
had not brought it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is just cruel,” answered the girl, throwing herself
into a chair, and clasping both hands over her eyes to hide
her tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are going, Eva. I promised it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>You</i> promised! poor darling!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did, indeed. So just wipe your eyes, and let me tell
you something. Look here! Hush, now! do not cry
out!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Ruth took a twenty-dollar note from under her
pillow, and held it up before Eva’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ruth, Ruth, where <i>did</i> you get that?” cried the girl,
in utter amazement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, <i>I</i> have been doing bits of work for it on the sly.
Eva! Eva! I won’t keep anything from you. Look here!
and here! I have earned it all with my pictures, that you
thought so pretty. This is for you. Stoop down, and let
me whisper what I mean to do with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva stooped down, and lifted her head again, all in a glow
of delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Ruthy! it seems like fairy-work! You have taken
away my breath!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They will take more; and that gentleman will teach me
how to give them greater perfection. You see it is no
dream, sister!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it was your genius that got me this invitation,
Ruth,” said Eva, with grateful enthusiasm. “I could not
understand it before. It seems almost possible that I may
go!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Almost! It is quite possible! I have been lying here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>with my eyes on the ceiling, thinking over the dress. It
must be lovely, you know, but not cost more than this one
bill. White tarletan, I should say, with a long train, a
flounce or two, and rows on rows of broad, puffy, ruches.
Crimson roses in your hair, and a little cluster on your
bosom. No! it shall be one, fragrant and half blown, on
the left shoulder. No other ornaments.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not, you foolish darling! How am I to get
them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a thing!—just the white and red. To think of it
is like painting a picture. I can see you now, with your
black hair falling in broad, heavy braids nearly to the
shoulders; two or three long ringlets sweeping almost to the
waist; just a little coronal of red roses over the forehead;
and the dress sweeping away, fold after fold, like dancing
white poppies over drifting snow. I tell you, Eva, it will
be superb.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how is all this to be done, Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall be bolstered up, and sew on it in the day-time.
You will help me at night. I tell you, dear, it will be
charming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you, poor dear, will be left at home, and see nothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, I! Indeed, you know nothing about it. I shall
just lie here, with my hands folded, so, and my eyes shut,
thinking over everything as it happens. The way people
will look at you, and whisper, ‘Who is that? Isn’t she—’
But I won’t tell you all that I shall see. Be sure you will
not enjoy it more than I shall. Then there is James!—won’t
it delight him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But mother! what if she forbids it?” said Eva, with
sudden dismay. “She might, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must get Mrs. Smith on our side,” said Ruth, faltering
a little. “Mrs. Smith, and our James. She cannot
stand out against them. But hush! she is at the door.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE HIDDEN PACKAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Herman Ross became a constant visitor at the Laurence
cottage after his sister had called there. Sometimes he
spent hours together in the little parlor, instructing Ruth in
her art, and fairly opening a new world to the genius that
burned within her. With all her practice she had gone
astray in many things, and struggled for hours to produce
an effect which he taught her to accomplish with a few dexterous
touches of the pencil. His patience seemed inexhaustible;
his kindness brought tears into her eyes whenever
she thought of it. In a few days she had learned
more than blind, unaided practice had done for her in years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes Ross saw Eva, but not often, for she came
home from her duties late in the afternoon, and his visits
seldom lasted till then; but he spoke of her frequently, and
sometimes questioned Ruth about her, in a cautious way, as
if the mention of her name brought some mental disturbance
with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, Eva older than I am? Dear, no!—far from it!
I am nearly four years the elder,” she said, one day, in
answer to his question. “It is because she is so tall and
well-formed that you think so; but she is only nineteen,
this month, while I am twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only nineteen! Just nineteen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just nineteen, this month!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me. Can you remember when she was born?”
inquired Ross, more quickly than he usually spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can remember when she was a baby; the very first
time I saw her was in father’s arms, coming through that
door.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you remember nothing before that?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“No! How should I?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing whatever—no disturbance in the house; no—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes! I remember very well how surprised mother
seemed, and how she scolded about something. I suppose
it was because father took the baby out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Strange!” muttered Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>That moment Mrs. Laurence came into the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You here, Mr. Ross?” she said, in her cold, half-indifferent
fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, madam. As an old friend of your husband’s, I
have taken the liberty of coming often, hoping to benefit his
child a little.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence looked at him, keenly. She was naturally
a suspicious woman, and intimate association with a person
connected with the police had not improved her faith in
human nature. She had seen this man regarding Eva with
looks that troubled her, and naturally supposed that his extreme
kindness to Ruth had some reference to the more
beautiful daughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Ross,” she said, with curt honesty, “I don’t remember
my husband having a friend in the world that I didn’t
know something about; but so far as I can remember, he
never mentioned the name of Ross to me in his life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The name of Ross!” cried the man, half starting from
his chair. “No wonder! what an idiot I was to forget!
But it is so long since I have known my other name. My
dear madam, have you never heard your husband speak of
Herman Ross Baker?”</p>

<p class='c006'>This name seemed to strike Mrs. Laurence dumb. She
stood for half a minute, gazing at the man, as if a ghost had
started up before her. The little color natural to her face
died out. Even her lips grew white.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman Ross Baker,” she repeated. “And are you
that man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is my name, Mrs. Laurence; and the only one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>your husband ever knew me by. I am an artist, and in other
countries chose to call myself Ross, leaving the rest of the
name so long out of use that I almost forget it myself.
Now, I hope that we are not altogether strangers, by name
at least.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence dropped into a chair, and clasped both
hands in her lap.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, you are that man!”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a look of absolute terror in the woman’s face.
She sat staring at Ross, with weird curiosity, as if he had
been a ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never thought you would come—never wanted you to
come,” she said, at last, wringing her hands with a show of
passion of which her countenance, in its set expression
gave little sign; “but when the dead order, the living
have only to obey. That which he left must be given,
though it breaks us all up and turns the house into a
tomb.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman rose from her seat, and began to walk the
floor, while Ross and her daughter sat regarding these
movements with intense surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean, mother—of what are you speaking?
Mr. Ross cannot understand,” said Ruth, arising with pain
from her cushions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence paused in her walk, and stood for a moment
gazing dumbly on the sweet, pale face turned so anxiously
upon her. Then she resumed action again, and paced
back and forth, as before, muttering to herself. At last, she
came up to the couch, and laying her hand on Ruth’s shoulder,
bade her sit up a little, while she searched for something
that must be found.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth left the couch, and sank into a Boston rocking-chair,
which Mr. Ross drew forward for her use.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Mrs. Laurence flung the cushions to the floor, and
bringing a pair of scissors from a work-basket, began to rip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the mattress, at one end, and thrusting her hand into the
opening, she drew forth a sealed envelope.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is the name,” she said, reading the address over.
“Herman Ross Baker. My husband did know you. When
he wrote this I was told to give it into your hands, and no
other, should you come back to this country, after he was
dead, which I am sure he did not expect. Take it, sir;
and remember he was kind to you and yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took the package, and looked wistfully at the writing.
He was evidently taken by surprise, and his hand
shook with the intense desire that possessed him to tear
the envelope and seize upon its secret at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not here! Read it at home!” said Mrs. Laurence, who
saw his hands tremble with eagerness. “It may be a thing
to read alone, with fasting and prayer. Who knows?
Take it away, and remember how true he was—how good.
Ruth, you are growing pale; let me lift you back to the
couch. No, sir; it is not needed—one is enough. There,
now; don’t be troubled, child. No need of that! You see
how weak she is, Mr. Ross; so have some compassion on us
all. You will understand me, by-and-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If compassion could make you happy, there would be
no sorrow under this roof,” answered Ross, with a ringing
sweetness in his voice, that brought tears to the eyes of
Ruth Laurence. “God knows, I will never bring trouble
here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth reached out her hand. “You have brought nothing
but good to us,” she said, gently. “We all know
that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took the pale, little hand in his, dropped it softly to
the couch again, and took his leave, with the feeling of a
man who carries destiny in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>A short walk brought Ross to his sister’s dwelling. He
entered the front door, strode across the tesselated hall, and
mounting the stairs, carpeted so thickly that his footsteps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>seemed smothered in wood-moss, entered a chamber in the
topmost story, which had been fitted up as a studio. With
a hand that still quivered with emotion, he bolted the
door, and sat down, with the envelope in his hand, overcome
with that strange dread which an unbroken seal often
brings upon the possessor. Eager as his curiosity had been,
he was literally afraid to break the seal. What did it lock
in? Why should the man, so long dead, write to him? Was
the vague, wild idea, which had haunted him for weeks, a
reality?</p>

<p class='c006'>With these questions in his brain, he tore the envelope,
took from it some closely-written pages, and began to read.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='large'>WHICH RIVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“My Friend—One night, while on my beat in the upper
part of the city, a young woman, carrying something in her
arms, which a large and very rich shawl completely covered,
passed me, more than once, in a wild, distracted way, as if
looking for something, or some place, which she could not
find. I watched her, carefully, as she went back and forth
in this strange fashion and at last saw her sink down on a
doorstep, when the faint wail of a child came from beneath
her shawl. I was about to speak to her, when she lifted
her head, saw my uniform, and starting up, came toward
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Will you tell me, sir, where I can find the river?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The voice in which these words were spoken was low
and timid. The female who uttered them seemed very
young, in the light of that street lamp, which was near
enough to reveal her features, as faces are seen in a dream.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>She was utterly unlike any woman who might have been
expected out of doors that time of night, and I looked at
her keenly before I made answer to her question; but her
head drooped forward on her breast, and I could only discern
that the face was both young and fair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Which river do you ask for?’ I questioned, wondering
that a young creature with the address and language of a
highly-bred person, could be there to make an inquiry so
vague and strange.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Any—no matter which. To find one, shall I turn to
the right or left?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was standing above Fiftieth Street on the west,
where many vacant lots lay between us and the Hudson,
which was not very far off; but shrunk from saying this,
and only answered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘If you turn either way there is a river—but this is so
strange——’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The girl did not hear my closing words, but turned to
the left, where the houses were scattered and a grove of
trees loomed up in the distance, flinging their shadows
against the sky. I could not leave my beat, but followed
her anxiously with my eyes, and saw that she walked with
a slow step, which bespoke great fatigue, if not absolute
despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘This is strange,’ I thought, ‘that voice had a desperate
meaning in it. I wonder if she really thinks of <i>that</i>;
poor soul!—poor soul, she will surely come to grief. If she
were not drifting out of my beat, I would follow her!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The moon was up, but clouded, and but few stars appeared;
so it was mostly by the street-lamps that I kept
her in sight, until she passed out of my beat. When I
lost sight of her, she was making straight for the river, and
hurried on as if urged forward by the fright my face had
given her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The clock from a far-off steeple struck the hour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“It was not many minutes before I was relieved, and free
to follow the woman, which I did, though she had lost herself
among the shadows. I then turned toward the river,
and followed the young creature at a cautious distance, until
she left the paved street and went into the enclosure of a
private mansion, where shrubbery was thick and the grass
so elastic that I could approach close to her unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She had heard the heavy rush of flowing waters coming
up through the solemn night, and quickened her steps as if
the voice of a friend had called to her from a great distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Oh, it is there! it is there!’ she moaned, ‘my last—last
friend—the only one that will take me in and hide me.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now her footsteps beat swiftly on the turf as she sped
onward, guided by the deep whispering of the waves. She
was skirting the walls of a garden, over which roses and
clustering masses of honeysuckles trailed out of bounds,
filling the night air with fragrance, that for one moment
evidently checked the girl in her progress; or she was
stricken faint with a sudden recoil of conscience, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘They are blossoming now—now around my window,
as they did then, just a year—only a year!’ I heard her
say.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The girl wrung her hands, looking wildly around, as if
she sought for some human being to pity her; but nothing
was near save the faint odor of flowers, that seemed to
wither her like poison; and the far off drifts of the river,
blended with the flow of a soft wind through innumerable
leaves, and the stir of roses under their dew.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The very fragrance and beauty of the night, while it
seemed to lift her soul out of its dull apathy, stung it to
desperation. She turned and fled from the garden wall,
and I lost her among the great primeval trees, that made
the place solitary as a hermitage. Without giving it a
thought, I plunged into the shadows of the grove, beyond
which the great river was flowing.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“I heard sounds of her progress through the undergrowth,
and followed with cautious swiftness; for her
dress, her air, and the child that she carried under that
shawl, suggested a tragedy, which it was my duty to prevent.
The street she had been threading, that immense
flower-garden, and the grand old mansion, which seemed as
if buried in the heart of a wilderness, the shrubbery was so
old and thick around it, were now left behind. I could
hardly see my way in the dense thickness of those trees
which grew close to the river, flinging their shadows over it,
in places, and making the spot so lonely that I felt a thrill
of dread, as the contrast between its isolation and the street
I had left, broke upon me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Everything was quiet. My own footsteps were smothered
in the forest-turf, and a gentle shiver of the leaves was
all the sound I heard. What had become of that poor girl?
Had she already found time to make the plunge I felt
sure she meditated. My heart shrunk from the thought,
so I watched and waited, feeling the presence of another
human soul, as one sometimes knows a thing independent
of the senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As I stood in the shadow, something seemed to move
on a large sloping-rock, which formed a picturesque feature
in one corner of the grounds, on which the trees grew less
thickly. That moment, a cloud swept back from the moon,
and I saw the woman whom I had frightened so, standing
on the rocks, which shot some distance into the stream,
where the waters eddied and curled around it with a sweet,
monotonous music, that seemed to lure and lure the woman
on, till she stood on the very edge. Her shawl was thrown
back now, and I saw the child. She did not look at it, but
turned her face away, and lifted the infant high in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I started forward, but checked myself, for she had fallen
down upon the rock, and hugging the child to her bosom,
was kissing it with passionate vehemence, calling out.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“‘I cannot—I cannot! Oh, my God! how could I think
of it? My child! My child! You are not hurt! There!
there! there! Oh, what can I do? what shall I do?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Again and again she fell to kissing the little creature,
moaning over it like a dumb animal; breaking forth into
bitter sobs, now and then, until some fear seized her, and
she looked around, evidently terrified by her own voice.
Full ten minutes she sat caressing the child, in her passionate
despair. Then she arose to her feet once more, uplifted
it in her arms, and staggering back, fell prone upon the
rock, clasping the infant to her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The struggle was terrible; but I had faith in the power
of a motherhood which could battle so fiercely against an
evil resolve, and waited, knowing, that at the worst, I could
save her and the child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She arose to a sitting posture, very pale and still now,
for I could see her face, plainly, in the moonlight; and it
was white as snow-white and beautiful. An exclamation
almost broke from me. <i>I knew the face!</i> More than once
had I marveled at its beauty; more than once had I seen it
beaming with love, uplifted to another face, which will
never leave my memory—that of a man I love better than
a brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you understand? Can you guess who this young
mother was? I did not know her name; but there was no
mistaking that proud, white face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The young woman sat a long time, gazing at her child,
in the moonlight, as if seized by some apathy of the soul
which made that rock its last anchorage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At last she took off her shawl, and, kneeling over the
little creature, wrapped the garment around it. She did not
look at it after this, but arose from her knees, and went
staggering away from the river, through a patch of moonlight,
and into the shadows, looking toward the rock, continuously,
as if she had left her heart behind, and longed to
pluck it back to her bosom again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“After she was gone, I went down to the rock which was
now bathed in the beautiful moonlight, and seemed as peaceful
as a cradle, for the waters as they swept around it murmured
a soft lullaby, and a poisonous vine, which had turned
scarlet in the hot sunshine, seemed in its duskiness and dew
like an imperial drapery cast around the little creature
where it lay.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A bramble studded with green acrid fruit, which bent it
down like the plume from a helmet, drooped its shadow
over the infant where it lay muffled in the shawl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I put the bramble away and was startled when two
great, wide-open eyes looked up at me, through the moonlight,
as if wondering at the rough features that met them,
instead of the beautiful woman’s face which had drifted
away from it through the shadows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I took the child in my arms, and laid its little cheek to
mine. The touch filled my soul with tenderness; having
seen that woman’s face I could not give that child to the
almshouse. No, I resolved that she should be my own—the
sister of my little Ruth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I carried the pretty waif home, and gave her to my
wife. She was taken by surprise, and resented the adoption,
at first; but it was impossible to resist those pretty,
infantile ways, and at last this child became dear to her as
our little Ruth. Yes; dear as the boy that was afterwards
born to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We kept the fact, that this child was not our own, a
secret from every one. Even our children are ignorant that
she is not in fact their sister. I never sought to identify
the young mother. Remembering how near she had
been to murdering her own child, I dared not place it again
in her power. Besides, we loved the foundling, and that
love grew strong as nature in our hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know that I was educated for a better position than
has fallen to my lot; and I resolved to give even superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>advantages to my children. My wife is a prudent housekeeper,
and out of our small resources we have managed to
save money enough for this purpose, and to secure a humble
home, in which we are now living. If God spares me, some
prosperity may yet be won out of our hard lives. But just
now, I am desponding, without reason, for my health is
good and my purpose strong. If I should be cut down,
what will be the fate of my family? I ask this question
with a pang. Have I done right to educate these two girls
for a position so much higher than they can ever hope to
attain? Have I done right in keeping all that I have told
you a secret from Eva herself? Was it not my duty to
search out the mother, who had cut her off; thus, perhaps,
securing to her a future more promising than anything I
had to offer?</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am asking myself these questions now, and the
answer is a selfish one. We could not give her up to
another.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My friend, let me tell you all. The woman who abandoned
her child, with such throes of anguish, was no
common person. Everything about her bespoke refinement
and wealth. The shawl, in which she wrapped her infant,
was a rare and costly one. The garments were enriched
with the finest lace; the sleeves were looped back with pink
coral—such as can only be found in perfection at Naples—fastened
with a clasp of gold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We kept these things, sacredly, thinking that the time
might come when Eva would be driven to seek out her
mother. But not while I live. She loves us, and is happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My friend, I have been thinking how suddenly death
sometimes comes upon us, and how helpless she will be,
with all her fine talents and rare beauty, when I am gone.
Thinking of this, how could I help remembering you, my
friend of friends. With a tenacity I cannot resist, the
thought fastens on me, that I should be doing you a wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>if I withheld our secret from you. Be this as it may, I
know that you will be her friend when I am gone. In her
time of need, should it ever come, you may search out that
portion of her history, which I have, up to this time, shrunk
from investigating.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If love for this child has made me secretive and selfish,
you will have the energy to redeem the wrong and place
her in the higher position which I solemnly believe to be
hers by right.</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing I charge you. If it should come out that the
girl has no legal right to claim her parents, keep this secret
from her, forever. She is proud, and so keenly sensitive,
that disgrace would kill her; in that case, my humbler
name would be far better than a dishonored one, however
exalted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are abroad now; but I have kept trace of you
through all these years. Once or twice your letters have
reached me. I know that you have won a high place
among men of genius; that your guardianship will be
an honor to this proud girl; that even for my own delicate
Ruth you will have some fatherly kindness. Am I wrong
in asking this? I think not. You are the only friend of
the old time that I have left. In our school days, we loved
each other; in our manhood the feeling grew and strengthened.
After my death, if that should come, you will be
mindful of the old love, and kind to those I leave behind
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One thing you will remember. My wife has the
clothes, the coral, and the India shawl, in which little Eva
was wrapped that night. She will give them to you, reluctantly,
I dare say; no misfortune will ever make her willing
to part with the girl; but she will remember my charge,
and give them up, at your request. Perhaps they will lead
to something in your hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why do I write this now, after so many years of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>silence? I cannot answer. But this evening, a strange,
dark presentiment came over me, and I was impelled to
place Eva’s story on paper. It can do no harm. My wife
will keep it safe till you come, if I am doomed. Doomed!
How absurd all this seems in a man of perfect health and
more than ordinary strength. It is strange and wild, but
troubled times are coming upon the land, times when these
death shadows will not be confined to one man. Yet, somehow,
I feel with mournful solemnity, that, after I am dead,
you will get this paper, and act upon it in behalf of your old
friend,</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'>THE PAWNBROKER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ross never took his gaze from the paper until he had
read it through: then he folded the pages back and reperused
every word, with a burning, eager question in the
eyes, that seemed to devour each syllable as it arose to view.
The perusal had left him pale to the lips. He held the
pages with a firm, hard grip, as if he feared they would
escape him, long after he had mastered their contents.
Then he arose, and began to pace the floor, with a slow,
heavy tread, pondering over many things in his mind, with
a restless burning of the eyes that bespoke a storm at the
heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>How was he to appease this craving curiosity? In what
way was he to arrive at the truth regarding this girl, whose
future had been placed in his hands, by the document still
clutched, tightly, there?</p>

<p class='c006'>Laurence was right. Herman Ross was not a man to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>falter in a case like this. If the girl had claims, he was
resolved to search them out, and maintain them after they
were found. But something more exciting than mere determination—an
almost frenzied wish to learn the whole
truth possessed the man. All the proofs that existed he
would have at once. Suspense was more than he could
bear.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took his hat, and went out again, walking rapidly
toward the Laurence cottage. This time he sought the back
entrance, and found Mrs. Laurence alone in her kitchen.
Her keen, grey eyes were as hard as steel, when she turned
them upon him, with a look that seemed half fear half defiance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” she said, sharply, “you know it all now. Is it
in you to take her away from us, now that we need her more
than ever?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have come to ask some questions. This paper speaks
of articles that are in your possession. May I look at
them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence sunk into a chair; the little color natural
to her face died out, leaving only a flush around the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I cannot give them to you just now,” she stammered.
“Did the paper speak of them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; and they are important—very important.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how was I to know that you would ever come, or
that anyone—a man particularly—would want a lot of
baby-clothes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do want them, and at any cost must have them,”
said Ross, almost fiercely, “Surely they are not destroyed?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Destroyed? No; I haven’t done that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross drew a deep breath, and the hot color, which mounted
to his face, died out as the woman completed her sentence.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“But they are not all on hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not on hand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What right have you to question me so? Most of the
things are here; but we were starving, sir—starving! Do
you know what that means? I pawned one or two things.
There, you have the truth. Go in and look at the pale girl
lying there; then wonder, if you can, that I gave up everything
to keep her from dying before my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But they can be found? Surely they are not out of
reach?” said Ross, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. We haven’t been rich enough to redeem
anything; but you shall have the tickets. Wait.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence went up the back stairs, and left Ross
walking restlessly up and down the kitchen. She was gone
some time, but came down at last, carrying a bundle in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here are the things,” she said curtly. “Yellow as saffron,
with lying; but here they are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She opened the bundle, and shook out a long infant’s
frock, trimmed half a yard deep with Valenciennes lace and
embroidery, all yellow with age, but of exquisite richness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross laid it aside with an impatient movement of the
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It tells nothing,” he said. “Nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The moths have got into the flannel,” said Mrs. Laurence,
passing her hand under the rich, silken embroidery
of a flannel skirt; “but you can see the pattern, for they
never touch silk. Some lady did that, let me tell you, with
her own fingers. This is no hired work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross glanced at the pretty grape-vine, which had grown
golden on the riddled flannel, and was himself struck by
its beautiful finish. All at once he snatched it from the
woman’s hold, and examined it more closely, as if he saw
something curious in every leaf and tendril.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should know the pattern. Somewhere I have seen it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>before,” he muttered, in a voice that was almost inaudible;
“but where? how?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is nothing else but this mite of a shirt, with lace
around it like a cobweb, and the linen so fine you could
almost pack it in a thimble,” said Mrs. Laurence, warmed
into soft, womanly feeling by the sight of these little garments.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing more? But the shawl, the coral—where are
they?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pawned!” was the curt answer. “I told you so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where? Let me look at the tickets,” was the impatient
rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence drew an old, worn porte monnaie from her
pocket, and took from it two pawn-tickets, which she handed
to her visitor, almost smiling at the disappointment that lay
before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross glanced at the tickets, and dropped them to the
table in bitter distress. They had been forfeited a whole
year.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did not suppose they would amount to much now,”
said Mrs. Laurence, picking up the papers. “Sold long
ago, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took the tickets from her hand again, and read the
address with a forlorn hope that the articles, so important
to his search, might be found unsold. He left the house at
once, and proceeded to the pawnbroker’s, scarcely heeding
or caring that the whole world saw him enter a place that
is the last foothold of poverty before it drops into abject
want.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE PAWNBROKER’S OFFICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A dull, dreary place was this pawn-office; its narrow
counter all grim with use; its walls studded from floor to
ceiling with miserable looking bundles; its boxes partitioned
off like cells in a prison, where the sensitive and inexperienced
sheltered themselves while taking their last degrading
steps on a downward career. All these things struck
Ross with a chill, for there is something fearfully pathetic
in poverty when it takes a form like that.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a sense of strange humiliation, this refined gentleman
glided into one of those secret boxes, into which want
shrinks from the human gaze with a keener sense of shame
than guilt often knows. His breath came short, and he
asked, hoarsely, if there was yet a possibility of redeeming
the articles which the two crumpled tickets represented.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pawnbroker, a heavy, dark man, whose hands were
as unclean as his practices, took the tickets, saw the date,
and handed it back with a gruff shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forfeited long ago. You ought to have seen that, if
you know how to read.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg your pardon,” said Ross, too anxious for resentment.
“Of course, I was aware of the date; but is it possible
to obtain these articles?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Obtain them? No; they are sold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross still held the rejected tickets in his hand, which
shook a little.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sold; but there must be some record. Is it not possible
to find them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t suppose it could be done. Whoever got those
two things had a bargain that they won’t be likely to give
up. The shawl was real Injy; worth a thousand dollars, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>it was worth a cent; and the coral was a lovely tint, like a
tea-rose, and carved beautifully—not to be matched in this
country. Bargains! Both great bargains!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am willing to pay their full price—double that—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ha! What is that? Double?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; that is not more than I am willing to give.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Double-double! That would be two—say three thousand.
Is that the correct sum—three thousand? A good
thing! A good thing, if you get them!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The craving wretch spoke gleefully, rubbed his palms
together, and eyed Ross as if he longed to devour him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through all his anxiety, Ross felt the disgust such greed
was sure to inspire, and answered him sharply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will give two thousand for the shawl, and two hundred
for the coral—not a cent more; but that can be settled with
the possessor of the articles, who will probably be content
with their full value. If you will inform me who the purchasers
are, it is all I desire at present.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who they are? Oh, yes! Such greenness belongs to
us. Young in the business, you know. Haven’t cut our
eye-teeth. You’re likely to get at them articles without me,
very; but how are you going to do it, that’s the figure?
How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you will not help me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why that is just what you and I are bargaining about.
Say three thousand, and I’m on hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three thousand for articles not worth more, by your
own showing, than a third of the amount, and for which
you only advanced fifty dollars. Surely, you cannot be in
earnest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In earnest? Well, you will find that I shall not abate
one dollar. A thing is worth what one can get for it.
You want this shawl and coral for something more than
their worth, and so make fancy stock of them. You understand
they are my fancy stock, and for any good they will
be to you, I am the holder.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“But they are sold, you admitted that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; but my books are not sold—and without them,
how can these things be traced? Oh, never mind! you
will come to my terms, people generally do!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took his hat from the counter, and turned to leave
the box, in which he had stood while conversing with this
man. The pawnbroker eyed him furtively, with a crafty
smile on his lips. He was not disheartened, for the anxiety
in those deep-set eyes was too apparent for doubt. The man
would make any sacrifice rather than lose the articles he
sought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will think better of it, sir,” he said, leaning over
the counter, and following the retreating man with an oily
smile. “Remember, I am always to be found here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross lifted his hat and disappeared, making no other
reply. For a moment, disgust of the man overpowered
even the strong wish that had brought him to that miserable
place.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. CARTER STANDS BY HER OLD FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Carter had that profound respect for her own taste
which springs out of utter ignorance; and her great party
would have been something wonderful in the way of shoddyism,
but for the gentle and kindly interference of her brother
Ross. But she looked upon him with something like
adoration, for his opinions were so modestly given, that they
seemed to originate in herself. Thus he had sent the gorgeous
pictures from her boudoir to Battles’ room in the stable,
and after them went many an object of inestimable value to
the lady, but which were received by the aesthetic coachman
with a sniff of critical contempt.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Up to this time the contractor’s lady had reveled in the
adornment of her house. She had often heard it said that
certain persons of her new circle, who had shot up like
mushrooms in the unhealthy atmosphere of our civil war,
owed all that was elegant in their establishments to the
artists and upholsterers they employed. This was a charge
Mrs. Carter resolved should never be brought against her.
So, after six months of hard worry and interminable shopping,
an effect was produced of promiscuous gorgeousness,
that was wonderful to behold. The really refined persons
who began to patronize her, were so completely surprised
by this display, that she mistook their amused astonishment
for admiration. This inspired her with new ambition, and
she plunged into attempts at harmony and contrast, that
fairly set the beholder’s teeth on edge as words of hollow
flattery passed through them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it was that Mr. Ross found his sister and her habitation.
Carpets, gorgeously independent of draperies; florid
frescoes, statues in deep shadow; flaming vases in the light;
mirrors in every available space; and pictures, such pictures!
in magnificent frames, surrounded him on every side. But
genius is great, and money all potent. Out of this confusion,
the man of real taste soon produced effects harmonious
as a poem; and no person could enter that mansion with an
idea that its arrangement had been left either to an upholsterer
or to an ignorant woman. Soon Mrs. Carter saw how
much more beautiful everything had become, and gloried
in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having surrendered so much to her brother, she was ready
to yield to him in all things connected with her social life.
When he suggested the purchase of Ruth Laurence’s
sketches, and asked for an invitation to the party, for
which cards were about to be issued, she consented at once,
and thus fell in with her old crony and friend, Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p class='c006'>One afternoon, Mrs. Carter came home in a state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>unusual excitement. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes
sparkled, and her style was like that of a warrior preparing
for battle. Without stopping to take off her things, she
mounted to her brother’s studio, which was in the very top
of the building.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman,” she said, sitting down by her brother’s easel,
“I’ve got myself into a scrape, and I want you to help me
out. Not that I need help, if Carter wasn’t so uppish about
such things; but he was determined that I should give up
the old set for good and all, when I came in here—and so I
did. The day I went to see that Miss Laurence, who should
come in but my old neighbor, Mrs. Smith, just as good,
whole-hearted a woman as ever lived. Of course, I was
glad to see her—my heart not being a nether millstone, nor
yet a junk of ice. Then she was natural as life, thinking,
no doubt, that I should keep her at arms-length, because
of all this silk and lace, and bracelets, and she only in a
calico-dress. I hadn’t the heart to do it, Herman; old
neighbors are old neighbors; and, between you and me,
brother, I’m not certain that them old times were so much
worse than these. At an rate, my heart warmed to Mrs.
Smith, and that child of hers, so that I hated to come home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter walked to the window, passed a hand
over her eyes once or twice and came back again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Smith has got a splendid baby, you know; and
holding it in my arms was such a heart-aching treat, after
all that we have lost, Carter and I. It’s a thing we never
mention between us; but the sight of a fine, wholesome
baby is sure to make my breath come quick. After losing
three of them, and none left, and this house built with a
nursery, it’s heart-rending to think of; and I couldn’t help
thinking that Mrs. Smith was richer than I was, after
all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we took dinner together—ham and eggs—real old
times; and cooked so nice. So, while the old home-feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>took full hold of me, I up and gave my old friend a card for
my party, having one in my pocket at the time. This was
the reason of my doing it, unthinkingly, as one may say,
and long in advance of other people. She was so pleased—tickled
almost to death; and is going to buy a new mory-antique,
and—what will please you, I know—says that she
will bring Miss Eva Laurance with her—carriage-hire
being all the same for three as for two.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Ross made an impatient movement, which his sister
saw, and half resented.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now don’t you turn against me, Herman. It’s bad
enough to have Carter curling up his nose at old friends,
that were always ready to help him, when he needed help;
but my own brother——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You misunderstand,” said Ross. “I find no fault with
feelings that do you honor.—Far from it. But as for Miss
Laurence, we had arranged about her coming, and there need
be no alteration in that, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Carter objects even to her. And as for Battle, his
sneers about going into that neighborhood are beyond bearing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps in some respects, Carter is right. You will
find it very difficult to make classes mingle harmoniously;
even in this republican country. Stronger and more experienced
woman than you have tried it, and failed signally.
A land that owns no aristocracy but that of wealth, will
always draw sharp lines between the poor and the rich.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you do not object—you will help me out. I wish
now it hadn’t been done; but one can’t take back an invitation;
and Carter is very cruel to ask it; isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you cannot take back an invitation. And I
dare say your old friend will manage to appear well enough
for the occasion. Society, since the war, has put up with a
great many strange innovations. So, I have no doubt that
your friend will pass.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“It’s kind of you to say so,” answered Mrs. Carter, with
tears in her eyes. “As for Carter, his heart is like a millstone,
since he became so rich. Oh, Herman! sometimes I
wish we had been content as it was.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well, throw all these little troubles off your mind.
I have something to tell you—something to propose. Perhaps
a great favor to ask of you and Carter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s granted, Herman. I’d lay down my life for you;
and so would Carter. He’s awful proud of having a real
gentleman in the family. So am I—and that gentleman
my own brother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross reached out his hand, and drawing the kind-hearted
woman toward him, kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now tell me what it is,” she questioned, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it’s money——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not that! Not that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear! Dear! What can it be then? Just tell me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not now. In a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Another invitation for some one? Well, you shall
have a whole handful of blanks, and fill them out yourself.
Will that do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For the present, less than that will do, sister.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, as many as you like, and anything else you like.
Now I begin to feel better, and will go down to Carter, like
the mistress of her own house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this heroic resolve, Mrs. Carter left the studio.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>YOUNG LAMBERT SPEAKS OUT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, mother, it is the truth; I have seen the young
lady more than once.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know it, Ivon. You were seen walking by her side
in the street.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert spoke calmly, but with a cold intonation
of the voice that her step-son understood as something far
more expressive than an outburst of anger; but his answer
was as quiet as her question had been.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Once or twice I found myself on the same side-walk
with the young lady to whom I have been properly introduced.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Properly introduced! How can that be? There is no
proper introduction between a shop-girl and a young gentleman
of position and fortune,” replied the lady, with an
angry flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Position, if you please; but as for the fortune, that
depends—— I claim nothing on expectations. It would
be arrogance if I did.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is a sudden fit of humility, Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, madam, it is not sudden; the thought has been in
my mind a long time. No man has a right to discount on
the future, or waste his energies because there is no
immediate need that they should be put forth. Say that I
am young, well educated, and have just property enough,
from my father, for individual independence, and you will
have defined my position exactly. Is it so very much
better than that of the young lady we are speaking of?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The young lady, as you call her, is a shop-girl,”
answered Mrs. Lambert, with unsuppressed scorn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And in that my superior. She earns her own independence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and aids those more helpless than herself, while
I——Well, it is useless to say what my life has been.
The greatest energies I have as yet been called upon to put
forth, is exerted in collecting your rents, and depositing
your money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are my son—not one person in ten remembers
that you are not actually so. Some day, if you do nothing
to prevent it, the bulk of my property will be yours. All
my real estate must descend to a Lambert. It is a proud
old name, and needs wealth to sustain it. To your father I
gave that wealth. It was a part of his greatness, and lifted
him above all the petty economies which have so often
degraded our American ministers abroad. It was my pride
that through me his position at the Imperial Court had no
such humiliating difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it was his pride, for he told me so a hundred times,
that no high-born lady of that proud land ever filled a lofty
position with more dignity and grace. Young, beautiful,
and richer in acquirements than in wealth, how could it be
otherwise? Ah, madam, he thought less of your property
than of those other things. Where love is, gold sinks to
the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert did not reply at once; a cold shadow crept
over the animation of her face, but she answered at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love is a delirium, which comes in force and power but
once in a lifetime—a dangerous insanity that never dies.
Do not permit it to overpower your reason, Ivon. Of all
the passions it is most to be dreaded.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how is one to guard against it, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot advise,” answered the lady, “for no human
being ever took counsel patiently from another, when this
passion was upon him. I can only warn you, my son, that
no greater trouble comes on earth than springs out of a
low-born union. It is the one mistake which can never
be wholly retrieved—class should match with class. When
love descends, it is terrible.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“But what constitutes class in a republic, mother, where
society is ever changing? One must merge into the other.
Look at the social upheaving which the war has brought
about, where the very lowest strata of society has been
forced to the surface, and claims rank with the best.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know, I know!” cried the lady, impatiently. “Poverty
itself is better than that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It seems to me that honorable birth, talent, and pure
morals, should form the aristocracy of a great nation—these
are personal attributes which cannot be attained by accident
or dishonesty, as money is often acquired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert made an impatient movement with her
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is useless arguing, Ivon. Class must be distinguished
as we find it. The Lamberts have no need to doubt their
position in any country. Be careful not to imperil it by too
open attentions to the girl I have been speaking of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, mother, she is refined and beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So much the more dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thoroughly educated, accomplished, even.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps! How am I to know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have seen her, heard her speak.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I have seen that she is dangerously beautiful;
heard her speak with shrinking, that seemed almost repulsion.
Ivon! Ivon! let me never hear of her again!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can you be so prejudiced, mother, knowing so little
of the poor girl?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much can you know, Ivon?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Everything. I have taken pains to inquire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Knowing that she was a shop-girl, what more did you
wish to learn?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All that could be told.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what <i>did</i> you learn?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The lady spoke breathlessly, as if the subject pained her,
and she was impatient to end it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“I learned who her parents were.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her father was a policeman.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A policeman! Well, what more?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is dead. This girl is helping to support his widow
and two other children, one a confirmed invalid. They are
very poor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then leave them in their poverty, I charge you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert spoke with unusual warmth. The subject
had disturbed her greatly. Something more deep and subtle
than her indomitable pride had been touched, of which she
was even herself unconscious.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br> <span class='large'>MISS SPICER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A card was brought into the dainty boudoir in which
Mrs. Lambert was conversing with her son. This was followed
so quickly by Miss Lucy Spicer, that there was no
possibility of refusing her admission, even if the occupants
of the room had desired it. But her presence was welcome
to the lady, for she arose promptly to receive her guest, glad
to escape a subject which was hateful to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looking younger and more lovely than ever!” exclaimed
Miss Spicer, after kissing the lady with enthusiasm.
“I wonder if it will be possible for me to grow
handsomer as I grow older? Of course not. It’s only
one or two women in a generation that can do that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Miss Spicer seemed to become suddenly aware of
Ivon’s presence, and addressed him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now this is a treat, Mr. Lambert; one never expects to
find you at home; but here, with mamma, in this bijou of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>a room, is a surprise. Come, now, let us make up before
the maternal ancestor. It wasn’t my fault. I couldn’t, for
the life of me, help seeing you, and that abominably handsome
shop-girl. Why didn’t you take a back street?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then it was Miss Spicer. I could not imagine who had
done me the honor of reporting my movements,” said the
young man, bowing low.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Angry, ha! Don’t like people to make a note of his
little escapades. Well, it isn’t quite fair. But when one
overleaps all the barriers of society so bravely, of course,
he must expect it to be known.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And, of course, young ladies who have nothing else to
do, must be expected to magnify and multiply the news.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer threw up her hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing else to do! Now I like that; as if there ever
was seen a creature so hard-working as a young lady in society.
Only think of the notes one has to write; putting off
disagreeable people, and enticing the other set on; the shopping;
the walks down town just as business breaks up, when
crowds of us turn southward as steadily as sunflowers keep
with the sun; hunting down dress-makers, tormenting milliners,
reading all the French novels, little flirtations with
one’s music-master, learning love phrases with one’s Italian
teacher. I tell you, Mr. Lambert, one has to crowd life even
to get in gossip and scandal enough to spice it respectably.
Don’t talk to me about having nothing else to do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never will again. The occupations you enumerate
are too grand and noble for dispute. Hereafter I shall set
down a fashionable young lady as the busiest and most useful
creature on earth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course we are. Eternally on the go, scarcely time to
breathe from morning till night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps that is why so many of them are called ‘fast,’”
said Lambert, demurely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you abominable creature!” cried the young lady,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>shaking her cane-parasol at Lambert. “That’s intended
for me; but I don’t accept it. You are to consider me as
among the prudes and conservatives, remember. Did I not
come here to rebuke your own fast conduct? Don’t expect
to get rid of the shop-girl by attacking me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have no wish to get rid of her in any way, Miss Spicer,”
said Lambert, gravely. “Nor do I care to make her
the subject of this conversation. Mother, have you any
commands?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert, who had been quietly listening to this war
of words, shook her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! if you are going down the Avenue, I don’t mind
walking a block or two,” said the irrepressible Miss Spicer,
pulling down her lace mask, and grasping the coral-mounted
handle of her parasol, as if it had, in fact, been a cane.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will require something of that kind to set you right,
after your promenade with the lady we don’t care to mention.
But, wait one moment, I had forgotten what brought me
here. Mrs. Lambert, do give me your advice. I have a
card for that Mrs. Carter’s party. What shall I do about
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert looked up quickly, and a flush of unusual
color came into her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I beg pardon; what did you say, Miss Spicer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only if I can venture on accepting. She is so awful
shoddy, it will be great fun.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have received cards,” answered Mrs. Lambert, quietly,
“and it is probable that I may accept.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer let her parasol drop to the floor, and clapped
both hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is splendid! Then we can all accept. They tell
me her house was like a curiosity-shop, when her brother,
a great artist, came from abroad, and pitched all the trash
she had been collecting, into the stable. He’s splendid,
every one says! Awfully handsome, and so aristocratic. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>know half a dozen girls that are dying to go on his account.
The wall-flowers are all in a flutter, I can tell you, for he
isn’t young.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert arose hastily, walked across the room, and
re-arranged the folds of an amber-satin curtain, that fell
over a broad window of the boudoir. In her nervous haste,
she loosened the heavy cords that held it, flooding the window
with silken drapery, and the room with mellow, golden
light.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer laughed, lifted her parasol from the floor, and
began gathering up the folds of silk with it, thus throwing
Mrs. Lambert’s face into full light.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, how strangely you look!” she said, in her reckless
way. “Pale as a ghost! Wanted air, and going to open
the window. I’ll do it for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A gush of fresh air swept through the open sash, and
brought some color to Mrs. Lambert’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you better, dear madam?” said Ivon, approaching
the window with tender anxiety.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better! No, indeed! I’ve not been ill. It was only
the shadows thrown from this yellow drapery. Help me
draw the cords. No, no! leave the lace down, a softened
light is pleasanter. Now, Ivon, I will not detain you or
Miss Spicer from your walk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is giving us both a polite dismissal,” cried the
young lady, laughing. “Well, come along, Mr. Lambert,
your maternal ancestor gives permission. I won’t take your
arm unless you insist. No one will have a right to think us
engaged, if I walk along demurely by myself, not even the
pretty——What, frowning! Well, I never will say she’s
pretty again—never! never! never!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXX.<br> <span class='large'>OLD MEMORIES AND PRESENT STRUGGLES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was some moments before Miss Spicer’s voice died
away at the front door; and for a long time Mrs. Lambert
walked to and fro on that moss-like carpet, treading down
its clustering blossoms as if she longed to trample them out
of sight forever. The elegant coldness of her manner had
vanished entirely; her hands were clenched, her lips moved,
uttering nothing but shadowy words, until at last they broke
into sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So they will make a lion of him. Even these girls have
found out how more than handsome he is; how infinitely
above the shallow men they profess to admire. Great
heavens! has it come to this? Thirty-nine years of age,
and jealous of him now, as I was then! Oh, how I did
love him—how I do love him! Can such feelings die?
Can the grave bury them? Can a human soul cast them
off? And I, I met him with scorn. The madness of that
fatal hour seized upon me when he stood before my face, like
one from the tomb. How could I look him in the face?
Why was it that my pride refused to bow itself, while half
my being yearned toward him? What does he think of
me? Scorn and loathing! Scorn and loathing! What
else can I expect? What else would a sane woman wish?
But is this sanity? Will this passion haunt me forever?
Even thus, is it not better than the barren life I have led
all these years?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman, too restless for continued motion, threw
herself on a couch, and buried her hot cheek in its amber
cushions, as she had done years before, when love for this
one man threw her heart into tumults of tenderness or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>doubt. Had years done nothing for her then? Had
time dug no gulf between them deep enough to terrify
her heart from its hungry longing? Had silence, like that
of the grave, failed to chill it into indifference?</p>

<p class='c006'>He had asked none of these questions. Would he ever
care to have them answered? Was the heart he had
given her, dead? Yes, yes! he had left her to bitter retribution.
The passionate reproaches with which she had
driven him from her in his first youth, when a keen sense
of his poverty and her riches gave a double sting to her
cruel words, had been fatal. Her sin against him had been
too great.</p>

<p class='c006'>This woman was not given to weeping, but she cried like
a child now. For weeks and weeks she had expected Ross
to seek her again. In spite of everything, she had a lingering
faith in the love which had seemed immortal, and still
trusted in the great nobility which had seemed capable of
infinite forgiveness. But he did not come; and now she
heard his name uttered by that flighty girl, suddenly, and
with flippant ease, as if it were not a thousand times
removed from her, or the females she coupled with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the lady lay prostrate thus wounding her soul with
bitter memories, her maid came in, saw that she was resting,
and left a note upon the table near her couch. She started
up, as the door closed, holding her breath. It was from
him; she knew that before the address met her eye—knew
it by the wild tumult in her bosom, by the joy and pain
that thrilled her from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>How strangely her name looked written in that hand.
The seal—ah, yes! she remembered it. Letters upon a
tombstone could not have made her heart sink so heavily.
Her fingers were cold as she broke the wax, and, oh! how
they trembled as she unfolded the paper underneath.</p>

<p class='c006'>The note began coldly. It addressed her as Mrs. Lambert—the
hateful name that clung around her like a serpent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>now. In that name the writer embodied ten thousand
reproaches—a world of withering contempt. It was needless,
she thought, to utter it in any other form. Still, he
made, or implied, a request—that was something; a request,
where he might have commanded, and she would not have
dared to disobey. It was a little matter. He had just
learned that an invitation had been sent to Mrs. Lambert
for his sister’s party—a thing he had not thought to provide
against—and which might seem like an ungenerous effort to
place her in a false position. It was, perhaps, best that
they two should learn to meet in the world to which she
belonged, and thus spare themselves the pain of such
accidental encounters as circumstances might force upon
them; but of that, she must judge, and hold herself free to
accept, or refuse, this invitation to his sister’s house, as her
own wishes might dictate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The note was cold and formal enough. Ross said nothing
of his own wishes, but left her free—a thing which no
woman ever yet desired, where the man she loved was concerned.
But, chilling as it was, this woman pressed it to
her lips and her heart, with a wild and passionate fervor
never known to her girlhood, or that of any other woman.
Over and over again she devoured the words with her eyes,
and would, if possible, have plucked them from the paper
with her lips. Would she go? Would she meet him
again? Yes; if an army had stood between her and him,
she would have forced a passage through. So completely
had her heart taken up its old passion for the man whom
she had cruelly wronged.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br> <span class='large'>BITTER JEALOUSY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Miss Spicer was not given to much ceremony at the
Lambert mansion. In an hour after she went down those
broad steps with Ivon Lambert, her high-heeled boots
pattered up them again; for the young man had lifted his
hat politely to her, when they came opposite a fashionable
club-house, and sought refuge there.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young lady had stood on the side-walk long enough
to get up a laugh, and clench her parasol, which she shook
at him, to the edification and amusement of half a dozen
young men gathered in the club-house windows. Then she
retraced her steps, and, much to her disgust, walked up the
Avenue alone, making keen observations as she went.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once the young lady started off into a quick walk,
and, having obtained admittance at the front door, ran up
stairs. Without waiting for an answer to her knock, she
darted into the boudoir, and found Mrs. Lambert lying on
the couch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do get up, this minute, Mrs. Lambert; they are going
by—that girl and the gentleman we were talking of.
What an awful flirt she must be—first one man and then
another. It’s just abominable! Oh, how I wish Ivon
could see her now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert started from her couch, and hurried to the
window, urged forward by an impulse that swept away her
usual slow grace of movement. Miss Spicer was astonished
at the impetuosity with which that delicate hand dashed the
lace curtains from before the glass.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quick as lightning, those jealous eyes took in the two
figures moving along the opposite side-walk. Both were tall
and of commanding presence. The man’s head was slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>bent; the girl’s face was uplifted, and she was listening to
him, with a smile on her lip. Truly, she was beautiful.
The face, too, seemed familiar; something she remembered
afar off, came back to her, as she looked upon it; something
lost and vaguely regretted; but what, or when known, she
could not tell—the attempt was like groping through a
dream.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that the man Ross you were speaking of?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert’s voice was low and forced. The lace
which she grasped shook in her hand so violently, that
Lucy Spicer must have seen it, if she had not been
crouching on the floor, and watching the two people
through the lower sash. As it was, she only answered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, that’s the man! Splendid, isn’t he? but old
enough to be her father, though’. Oh, I hope she’ll catch
him, if it’s only to spite Ivon! for he treats me shamefully;
indeed he does. If I could only give myself time, I’m sure
it would break my heart, the way he goes on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert heard nothing of this. She was only conscious
of a quick, darting pain, which settled down into
leaden heaviness, through which she could hardly breathe.
Those two people went slowly out of sight, the lace dropped
from her hand and fluttered down, softly, as snow-flakes fall,
under the warm amber of the curtains. In this rich twilight
the woman hid her pallor, and the red flush about her
eyes, from the curious girl, who still sat watching on the
carpet, and went back to her couch, hearing the clatter of
that ceaseless tongue as men listen to a far-off wind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Lambert, now remember, you saw this girl flirting
like wild-fire with a man she never saw before half a dozen
times in her life; that’s certain, for I’ve taken pains to
find out all about him. There never was so great an artist
born as he has been. Gets thousands and thousands for a
picture; so that he don’t trouble himself to paint for common
people. Besides all that, he’s the only brother that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>rich Mrs. Carter has got; and her husband says he don’t
want a better heir to his property; so he’ll be an awful
catch, everyway; quite too good for that creature. If it
wasn’t for getting into a scrape with Ivon, I’d cut in there.
I have a mind to do it now. It would serve Ivon right for
daring to walk with her and own it to my face. Couldn’t
even take the trouble to cheat me with a fib. I hope you’ll
give it to him, Mrs. Lambert; he don’t care a cent for what
I say. Won’t you, now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the young heiress gathered her plump little person
from the carpet, and knelt down by the prostrate woman,
who lay with her face turned to the cushions, which her
hands grasped nervously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will talk with him, Mrs. Lambert, alone, and earnestly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Talk with him! No, that can never be again!” cried
the woman, in her passionate grief, lifting herself from the
couch. “Why should we two be alone? I am nothing to
him. That day has gone with my youth and beauty; these
it was that he loved. How much of them is left?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The unhappy lady threw out her arms, as if appealing to
her own image. In a great mirror opposite her couch, the
pale, anxious, disturbed shadow of a woman flung out her
arms also, as if repelling her appeal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer was astonished; she had been speaking of
young Lambert, and found this burst of feeling incomprehensible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How I’m sure you are mistaken,” she said. “Men
don’t care a bit about their mother’s beauty, and can’t, in
reason, expect them to be young. I’m sure Ivon loves you
a great deal better than most sons love their own parents.
So do think of it, and give him a good talking to; for one
thing is certain, I’m not going to take up with a shop-girl’s
leavings.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In a confused, weary way, Mrs. Lambert comprehended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>that the girl was speaking of her own affairs, and had no
idea of the anguish which had made her so reckless of exposure.
She seldom lost her proud self-possession so thoroughly,
and made a strong effort to recover herself before
that sharp girl could observe how disproportioned her agitation
was to the ostensible subject in question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Excuse me, Lucy, my head is aching fearfully.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor dear! I know how to pity you; only mine is the
heart, which your cruel son is just breaking,” answered
Miss Spicer, pressing both hands to her right side, just
where the organ she spoke of was not, and shaking her
head woefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>This attempt at the sentimental did more toward restoring
Mrs. Lambert’s composure than any amount of reasoning
could have done. A keen sense of ridicule broke up
the tumult of feeling that had almost prostrated her, and,
spite of it all, she smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How am I expected to help you, Lucy?” she said, with
something of her usual sweet manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Mrs. Lambert, I have just been telling you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that was while my head ached so badly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if people won’t listen, it’s of no use to ask advice;
but, if I must say it all over again, I want you, in short, to
give that son of yours a good, hard scolding.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never scold,” answered Mrs. Lambert, with a grave
smile, for there was trouble at her heart yet, not the less
keen because pride held it in abeyance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then, stop giving him money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! but I rather think he would like that, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like it! Like it! No he wouldn’t!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know; he’s getting restless, of late.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ever since he saw this girl—I wish that shawl had
been in the bottom of the Red Sea! Oh! if I had her within
reach of my cane-parasol for ten minutes! Did you ever
see such a great, tall thing as she is? Sweeps along like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a peacock. Oh, mercy! There he is coming! Don’t tell
him that I’ve been here. I’ll run down the back stairs, and
out through the garden!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br> <span class='large'>DRESSING FOR THE PARTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva Laurence was dressing for her first party, and the
very anticipation of its delights gave resplendence to the
wonderful beauty of her face. She was young, ambitious,
and rich in that vivid talent which doubles enjoyment and
gives a keener edge to pain than ordinary natures ever
endure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth was sitting up, among the cushions of her couch,
looking bright and happy as an angel. Her soft eyes were
full of serene love-light; a faint color came and went in her
cheeks; and little quivers of delight stirred her fingers, as
she smoothed the drifts of snow-white tarlatan that draped
her sister’s slender person.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, how beautiful it is! How soft and white! You
look like a bride, Eva!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Or a ghost!” muttered Mrs. Laurence, in a troubled
undertone. “The ghost of a child we have sheltered and
loved, but who will belong to others when we want her
most.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you saying, mother?” cried Eva, who was
stooping forward to look at herself in a little mirror between
the windows, which just took in the outlines of her splendid
neck and shoulders. “Something about my dress that you
don’t like, I suppose. It was extravagant spending so much
money; but you must scold Ruth. She would do it,
wouldn’t you, Ruthy, dear?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Oh, yes! mother must scold me! but she won’t do it, in
earnest. I’m not afraid. Didn’t she work like a regular
seamstress, to help finish the dress; and isn’t it beautiful?
All it wants is a little warm color.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It wants nothing in the world,” said Eva, passing both
hands over the dark braids of hair that fell in rich loops
down her neck, making its whiteness like the leaves of a
magnolia flower. “I never was dressed so well in my life,
and, perhaps, never shall be again, who knows?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know,” answered Ruth. “These fashionable people
adore good looks; and, oh! sister Eva, how beautiful you
are! Come down here, and let me kiss you. How warm
and red your cheeks are; it is like feeling a peach at one’s
lips. How I would love to paint you just this way, only a
little color in the dress. I insist on that for the picture; it
costs nothing, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come in,” Mrs. Laurence called, a little sharply, for
she was ill at ease that evening, and even a knock at the
door annoyed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was only little Jimmy, who peeped through the door,
after knocking, to make sure that even his presence might
not create some confusion, while that momentous toilet was
in progress. He carried a mass of loose roses in his arms,
white, golden-tinted, and red, some half open, some in full
bloom, and others folded buds, clasped in with moss.</p>

<p class='c006'>No wonder Ruth uttered a glad cry, and clapped her delicate
hands, gleeful as a child who suddenly finds its wishes
gratified. No wonder Eva sprang forward, and put a hand
on either side the boy’s face, and kissed him, rapturously,
over and over again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You darling! You boy of boys! Where did you get
them?” she cried. “Oh! how could I be so careless?”</p>

<p class='c006'>In her eagerness, she had swept half, the flowers from
Jimmy’s arms, and they lay at her feet, sending up odors
that filled the little room. She stooped to gather them up,
still questioning him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Where did they come from, so fresh, and such long
stems? There is one on your train; it seems to be buried
in snow—such a lovely color,” cried Ruth, fairly trembling
with delight. “Now I will make the dress perfect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where did I get them?” answered James, emptying
his fragrant burden on Ruthy’s couch, and kneeling down
to gather up the portion scattered around Eva. “It’s a
pretty way to find out, smothering a fellow with kisses, and
asking him to talk. Well, if you want to know, a friend
of mine gave them to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A friend? Oh, James!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I say it again—a friend. You have seen him,
Eva, through an iron fence; gray hair; legs like broomsticks.
Does it strike you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, that old man?. No!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you, yes! He was watching for me by the gate.
I’d been leaving some groceries in the basement, you know,
and took a peep through the railing. Always do. The
gate opened softly, and his queer old face looked through.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘Come in!’ says he. ‘Have you got a basket?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No,’ says I. ‘The cook hadn’t time to empty it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Well, come along; I want to send something to that
pretty sister of yours,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I went in, so astonished, that I was steering through
the middle of a flower-bed, when he called out, ‘This way!’
and went on among a whole heap of bushes, just as full
of roses as they could hold. Here he took out a great
jack-knife, and cut away like fun, giving the flowers to me
till my arms were full, and their breath made me long to
dance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Take them to the young lady,’ says he, ‘and say it
wasn’t just old Storms that sent ’em, but some one else
that——’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, James! did he say that?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Of course he did, and more yet; but I’ll tell you that
when we are all alone. It’s sort of private.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the boy made signs, and whispered mysteriously,
glancing at his mother, who was retreating to the kitchen
with a cloud of unusual darkness on her face. She saw in
all these excitements only signs of disaster and separation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br> <span class='large'>ABOUT THE ROSES AND VIOLETS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Now we are by ourselves, girls,” said James, “I’ll tell
you all about it. There was some one else in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some one else!” exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva, blushing vividly over face and bosom, began to arrange
the folds of her dress with great earnestness, but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know who it was, Eva,” said James, with a sly
glance. “I’ve seen you walking with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, James! only as he was coming the same way.
Don’t believe it, Ruth. I never did more than that,” cried
Eva, eager to defend herself, yet trembling with a sense of
shame.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who said you did? Oh, Eva! Eva! I’ve found out
something. It wasn’t old Storms that gave you this, anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here James held up a little cluster of sweet-scented
violets and sprigs of heliotrope, gathered around a moss
rose-bud.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>He</i> picked this, Eva, with his own hands. I wish you
could have seen what a fuss he made in putting them together.
Old Storms offered to help him, but he said, no!
he would do that himself. Then he said, ‘Give this to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>your sister; I know that she is going out to-night, and
shall be honored—that’s the word, Eva—honored if she
will wear it.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva took the tiny bouquet and held it, irresolute, casting
a shy glance at her sister, who looked gravely, almost reproachfully
at her.</p>

<p class='c006'>James, who was watching them both, broke forth in his
boyish impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, now, Ruth, don’t be an old maid, and spoil all her
fun. She hasn’t done anything, I tell you. Not one quarter
as much as all them Fifth Avenue girls are doing every
hour of their lives. Now what are you pouting for?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth smiled again. A sudden doubt had haunted her
for a moment, but it passed from her innocent mind like
dew from a lily, and all was bright again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is he, Eva?” she said, reaching out her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A gentleman, Ruth, if ever one lived. He has been at
the store several times, and Mr. Harold introduced him.
They went to school together, and—and that is all. Only
his name is Lambert—Ivon Lambert.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“His mother is as proud as if she were governor of North
America; but he isn’t—not a bit of it,” broke in James.
“The way he talks to me is quite friendly. That fellow,
Boyce, now, would never condescend to it, knowing that I
’tend that baby sometimes; just as if he and his red hair
was anything particular. If Mr. Lambert had not been a
thorough gentleman, I wouldn’t have brought his flowers,
anyway. You ought to have known that, Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if I did not know it,” answered the sweet invalid,
penitent and ashamed of the momentary cloud that had
come over her. “Eva, dear, let us begin again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth gathered up the flowers in her lap, and began to
arrange them in glowing clusters, with which she looped
back the over-dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now just a dash of this warm crimson for your hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and nothing can be more lovely,” she exclaimed, pulling
Eva down to her knees, and fastening a red rose and some
of the mossiest buds among her braids.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Eva arose from her knees she held the little cluster
of violets in her hand. Looking wistfully down upon
the blossoms, she unconsciously took a position, which filled
Ruth with the enthusiasm of an artist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if I could paint her now!” she thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would there be any harm?” questioned Eva, in a low
voice, turning her eyes wistfully from the flowers to Ruth’s
glowing face. “I—I suppose he would rather expect it.
Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth smiled, and held out her hand for the flowers, but
Eva pretended not to see her. Even to that gentle hand
she would not, for one moment, consign the previous
blossoms. So, with a gentle wile of abstraction, she placed
the flowers on her bosom, which rose and swelled to their
almost imperceptible touch, as waters bear lotus-flowers on
their waves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, isn’t she stunning?” exclaimed James, moving
in a circle, and on tiptoe, around the room, afraid of touching
the snow-white train with his foot. “That Miss Spicer,
who goes down the avenue to meet him, every day at three
o’clock, will be nowhere. In fact, I don’t believe there’ll be
a handsomer girl at the party to-night. She’s A No. I, and
a picked article at that. Hallo! Who’s coming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>James heard the outer door open, without a knock, and a
heavy rustle of silk in the passage. Eva gathered up her
dress, and sat down on Ruth’s couch, ashamed of her own
beauty, and wondering who the intruder could be. Ruth
smiled, and said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dare say it is Mrs. Smith.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So it was, that good woman in all her glory. She pushed
the door wide open; for, with a huge panier added to her
own generous proportions, the skirt of her dress turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>upward, and thrown over her shoulders, that open space
seemed scarcely sufficient to admit her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just run down to give you a look at my dress before the
carriage comes,” she exclaimed, flinging an avalanche of red
moire antique down from her shoulders, and spreading it
along the humble carpet with the pride of a peacock.
“What do you think of that, now? Seven dollars a yard,
and twenty-five yards, besides trimming. Going it, rather,
for a corner groceryman’s wife, isn’t it? But when an old
friend asks you, a’most with tears in her eyes, to be at her
first party, one can’t refuse to do the thing up brown, which
I think Smith and I have done it. Low in the neck, you
see, and Marier Antoinet sleeves to say nothing of white
kid-boots, with heels like that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Smith lifted her dress and brought to view a
high-heeled boot, strained till the buttons threatened to fly
off, over a large, dumpty foot, looked exceedingly like an
apple-dumpling prepared for cooking.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, now, girls, just take a survey of me all round,
and give us your opinion; but first, Eva, let me have an
observation. All in white, and looking like one of them
great swans in the Park; not bad! Though I should like
something a little more stylish. You are going as my friend,
and I’m anxious about your looking first rate. Still, it’s
my candid opinion that you’ll do. Step out here, and let us
see how your dress falls. Gracious me, what a train!
Longer than mine, I do believe; streaming out like a white
banner. Yes, I say it again; you’ll do, Eva! Now just
manage a thing or two for me. I couldn’t trust Kate
Gorman to put on my head-dress, and brought it along.
Stylish, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith drew a paper from her pocket, and unfolded
a yellow feather, long enough to take in her head at one
sweep, which she held up triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See how it curls and quivers; something like a feather,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>that! Now, I want you to put it on, like a queen wears
her crown, over the forehead, round one side, and streaming
out behind!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva and Ruth changed glances of dismay. Both
hesitated to wound the kind woman’s vanity, but felt that
silence would be cruel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would not wear anything on my head, Mrs. Smith;
you have such fine hair, it seems a pity to conceal it,” said
Ruth. “Let me do some braids, and change it a little.
Then you can have nothing more becoming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I bought the feather a purpose,” answered Mrs.
Smith, eyeing her purchase with rueful regret; “and it is
such a splendid one, with a contrast to it. That was what
the milliner observed when I told her the color of my
dress.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still I would not wear it this evening. Eva sees a
great many stylish people, you know, and can tell you that
feathers like that are not in the fashion for evening-dress,
just now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if she says it, I’ll give in!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then let me change your hair at once. Sit down by
me. What quantities of hair, and how long!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Deftly, and with fingers that seemed to fly through the
long tresses of hair, Ruth soon crowned the head of her
friend with a matronly coronal of braids, and made some
other alterations in her dress, which were submitted to with
inward protest. Just as the last touches were given, a
carriage drove up, and some one rang the door-bell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith sprang to her feet, drew up the skirt of her
dress, and ran into the kitchen, protesting that she would
not see a stranger for the world. As her dress swept with a
rushing and voluminous rustle through one door, Mr. Ross
came through the other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. CARTER BECOMES FASHIONABLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Carter’s party had been the grand sensation of
a week. Fashionable circles were profoundly agitated by
the great social question it evolved. The word “shoddy”
became inelegantly common in ladies’ conversation. Fastidiously
exclusive people, whose fathers had raised cabbages,
sold milk, and fattened pigs on land that time, rather
than ability, had paved inches deep with gold, smiled significantly,
or answered with delicate reserve, when asked if
they would be at the Carters’. In fact, superfine jests and
aristocratic sneers were the order of the day, until Miss
Spicer made a round of calls through all the windings and
ramifications of uppertendom, when a marvellous change
was produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course,” the young lady said, “Mrs. Lambert was
going, and openly expressed herself as highly pleased with
the invitation. Why not? Mrs. Carter was enormously
wealthy. Shoddy, indeed! What of that? After a great
civil war, society, like States, must be reconstructed.” Mrs.
Lambert and herself had settled on that, and nothing could
move them; the thing must be done in the most liberal
manner. The aristocracy of wealth had no right to exclude
a lady like Mrs. Carter; as for the smaller and more exalted
circle of genius, the lady’s brother, Mr. Ross, stood high
among the highest there—so the family had a double claim
to consideration. At any rate, Miss Spicer went on to say
Mrs. Lambert had accepted, and ordered one of the loveliest
dresses for the occasion. In fact—though it was not a
thing to talk about—some of her diamonds were being reset
at Ball &#38; Black’s. For years Miss Spicer had not seen
Mrs. Lambert enter into the spirit of a grand toilet with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>such zest. She was anxious as a girl of sixteen about it.
When a royal prince was here she had not cared half so
much; but then Mrs. Lambert always did adore genius;
and Mrs. Carter’s brother was something really distinguished
in that line—painted like an angel, and in conversation
was perfectly splendid.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was wonderful how much effect these repeated conversations
of Miss Spicer had upon the great social mind of
the metropolis. The diverging current turned at once in
favor of the Carters. Those who had openly called the
lady vulgar, now found her remarkably stylish—not handsome,
but queenly and imposing; so generous, too. If she
was a little showy and all that, it was because a rich, natural
taste was likely to develop itself gorgeously when plenty
of money was at hand. Her party would be something
perfectly magnificent. Her orders for flowers had exhausted
every green-house for miles around, and the supper would be
marvelous. It was said that an <i><span lang="fr">artiste</span></i> had come out from
Paris to preside over its preparation.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this came from Miss Spicer, who entered into the
subject with spirit and imagination enough to have given
sensation for a first-class novel. So Mrs. Lambert, sitting
still in her shaded boudoir, regulated society as she had
done for years, without apparent effort; in fact, caring very
little about it, except on this especial occasion, when she
felt a nervous satisfaction in being the unknown fairy who
turned the whole fashionable world into Mrs. Carter’s
saloons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The night came at last, and Mrs. Laurence’s humble
parlor was not the only one in which anxious and beautiful
women were adorning themselves before their mirrors,
though it was doubtful if one so small as that hanging between
those parlor windows was consulted during the evening;
or if the loftiest and broadest gave back a figure of
more perfect loveliness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Mrs. Lambert stood in her dressing-room, radiant with
jewels, pallid with nervous excitement. She was still a
beautiful woman; her mirror reflected that and more, it
revealed the faint shiver of her hands, the anxious fire in
her eyes, the swell and contraction of her white throat,
under its diamond necklace. Ellen, her maid, had never
seen her so strangely restless before; she turned her eyes
imploringly on the girl, and besought her to say honestly if
she looked so old as nine-and-thirty. The maid clasped her
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, indeed, Mrs. Lambert, you do not look it by ten
years.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The proud woman smiled, and touched the girl’s shoulder
caressingly, for the first time in her life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look again, Ellen; can you see no lines on my forehead,
no contraction here at my throat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing of the kind; if they were there, I should, the
diamonds light them up so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And my hair. Ah! Ellen, I see threads of white.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is because you are looking for them; besides, your
hair is so glossy and black, the least thing shows. A dust
of powder, now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, no! He detests—— You ought to remember
that I detest powder. Take the jewels out of my hair,
they kindle up every defect. My dress, too, looks presumptuously
youthful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Youthful, why not? There will be no young lady at
the party half so beautiful. Besides, this shade of mauve
is neither old nor young, so delicate and rich; just a
glimpse of blue, with a faint blush of roses breaking out,
as the dress-maker said, when it came home, ‘something
for point lace flounces to tell upon,’ says she, ‘satin thick
as a board, sweeping so majestic, with the lace floating over
like—like mist.’ That is what <i>she</i> said, but then, of course,
you know best, ma’am—nobody ever had so much taste.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Mrs. Lambert was not listening, but unclasped her bracelets,
and took off her necklace with an air of disgust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One would think I intended to dazzle the crowd,” she
muttered, “as if such things could do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, madam! you are spoiling everything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert looked at herself drearily in the glass,
her dress had lost it brilliancy—she seemed growing older.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Put them on, again,” she said, holding out her white
arms, as if the glittering jewelry held by her maid were
manacles of iron. “Nothing seems to become me, to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, madam, I never saw you look so lovely; no girl
ever had an air like that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This professional flattery was received by the lady with a
quick feeling of interest. She longed to believe the girl;
longed to think that much of the freshness and dew of her
youth remained.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellen,” she said, with an appeal for truth in her words,
and a piteous shrinking from it in her eyes, “no one will
look on me with your partial eyes; suppose you had not
seen me since I was—well, since I was married to Mr. Lambert,
you remember that, just a chasm of so many years to
leap over, would you find me so little changed then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, ma’am, and I would!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl spoke honestly; flattery had become second
nature to her, and she believed every word of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert drew a soft, deep breath; she had lost
faith in her own judgment, and it was pleasant to have her
doubts swept away, even by the opinion of a menial. She
drew on her gloves, and took up her fan, with a bouquet of
tea-roses that old Storms had sent up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Madam, are you ready?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man stepped into the room with an exclamation
of surprise at his step-mother’s beauty. The admiration
was genuine; Mrs. Lambert’s eyes kindled under it,
and a warm blush swept across her face.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“It is because you love me, Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, it is because I cannot help thinking you the loveliest
woman in society. I never saw but one——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man broke off, blushing more vividly than his
mother had done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, that one, Ivon?” said the lady, with shadows
gathering upon her face. “Surely, you cannot mean—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do, mother; to me there is only one other—but
we will not speak of her. The carriage is waiting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert allowed Ellen to wrap her in a soft, white
opera cloak, and bent her head for a cloud of zephyr
worsted, that fell as light as snow upon it. At another
time, she might have felt angry with Ivon for his mention
of a girl she repudiated. But now she was self-occupied,
and scarcely heeded it; so, wrapping the snow-white mantle
around her, she descended to the carriage, with a feeling of
anxiety which had not possessed her for years.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br> <span class='large'>A STRANGE PROPOSAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>An hour before Mrs. Lambert commenced her toilet, Mrs.
Carter entered her own private sitting-room in full dress,
ready for her duties as a hostess. Her brother had sent up
word that he wished to speak with her before the guests
began to arrive, and she was waiting for him with some
impatience, for the grand epoch was drawing nigh, and she
was rather anxious about the state of affairs below. She
was fanning herself with vigor, wondering in her heart
what Ross could have to say, when the artist came in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then all the good woman’s impatience vanished, and she
came forward to meet him with her usual genial warmth.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Now, what is it you want to say, Ross? Of course,
whatever it is, I am ready to do it; but we must talk fast, or
there’s no knowing what will go on down stairs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let your people take care of that, sister, they will know
what is proper,” said Ross, smiling kindly upon the good
woman, who laughed in return.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see I did not wear them after all; just a little
cluster here, to gather in the black lace—that don’t amount
to anything, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Carter glanced down at her silver-grey satin
and soft black lace with something like a sigh. It was not
at all the toilet she had decided on, but Ross, with suggestive
insinuations, had toned down the superb conglomeration of
lace, satin and jewels, into this rich, matronly dress, which
really made Mrs. Carter look almost aristocratic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing could be more becoming,” said Ross, in reply
to her half-reproachful glance, “I am so pleased that you
preferred to wear the lace I brought you. As for the brooch,
it is just enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, dear, if you think so; Carter rather wanted me
to flare out a little more, but, of course, you know best.
Now, what is it you want to talk about? Sit down here,
and let us take it comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross seated himself upon the couch from which Mrs. Carter
swept back her garments to make room for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sister,” he said, with a faint quiver in his voice, “I
have been thinking that you and I would be much happier
in this great house, if we had some young person to enliven
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter drew back in her seat, and lifted both hands,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman Ross, <i>does</i> this mean that you want to marry a
young wife?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sister, I have no thought of marrying any one;
but I do think of adopting a girl, and want you to help me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Adopting a girl? Why, Ross, that is just what I have
been thinking of myself—a pretty, little, curly-headed child,
like one that’s in her grave. Of course, I’ll help you;
more than that, I’ll do it for you—she shall be mine and
Carter’s heiress.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was thinking of one who shall be my heiress,” said
Ross, gently. “I cannot give her millions, but there will
be enough for us both.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thinking of one—why, who can it be, Ross? I had no
idea of your taking a fancy to any child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor have I, this is a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You? You, Ross? A young lady?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I will adopt her; all that I have or may have, shall,
in the end, be hers. What I want of you, sister, is motherly
protection for the girl. You will not refuse her a
home?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Refuse her! When did I refuse you anything? But
a girl—a young lady—I don’t understand. Is it any one I
know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have seen her. You remember the young lady who
helped select your shawl—Miss Eva Laurence?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That splendid creature! You adopt her?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I will adopt her; in fact, you must do it for me if
possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And she is to live here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is what I desire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As my daughter?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you be ashamed of her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ashamed? Why you and I can make her like a princess.
She can go out with me in the carriage, write my letters,
make calls. She shall have a maid of her own—shopping
money without end.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there, sister, your heart is running away with
you. We must be kind to the girl without spoiling her.
She is a sweet, modest young creature, rich in feeling and
bright as a flower. Let us keep her so.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Of course—of course! Carter will be delighted. He
does so like a pretty face, and hers is lovely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he may not consent?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He? Of course he will! All she’s got to do with Carter
is to have his slippers ready, and read the newspaper
for him, now and then; for, between you and me, Carter is
not much of a reader, on his own hook. Oh, he’s sure to
like it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross leaned forward and kissed the flushed cheeks, which
had become rosier and rosier, with the warmth of a generous
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then we will consider it settled,” he said. “I mentioned
it just now, because this evening will be an excellent time
for introducing her as a friend of the family. That was a
part of my idea, when I asked you to invite her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This evening? Well, why not, she can help me receive.
It will be splendid. I only hope she will be dressed properly—that
is, like the heiress we intend her to be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We need not doubt that—now I will go for her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I’ll just step down and have a talk with Carter
about it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE WAY SHE MANAGED HIM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ross and his sister parted; she went into her husband’s
room, and found him in the agony of putting on a new dress
coat, rather too small, and which fitted him like a straight
jacket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Carter—Mrs. Carter, just come and give this skirt
a pull, won’t you? I feel as if corked up in a junk-bottle.
Confound all your parties, and everything else that takes a
fellow out of his frock-coat!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Why, Carter, dear, it’s a lovely fit. Of course you
must expect to be tightened up a little at such a time.
Only look at me, would you ever have believed my waist
could have been brought down to that, yet I don’t complain.
There are things, Carter, for which we must suffer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Carter wiped his red face with a towel, there being
nothing else convenient, at which his wife cried out, “Why,
Carter!” and ran to a drawer, from which she brought a
handkerchief of the finest linen, with an embroidered monogram
in the corner. Over this she dashed a liberal quantity
of perfume from a scent-bottle, which she shook as if it
had been a pepper-box. Then she brought out a point lace
barb, parted over a white, silk cravat, which she tied around
his stout, red neck, leaving a kiss on his cheek when it was
arranged to suit her.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this had its effect. In spite of his coat, Carter softened
and became amiable. His hair had been nicely curled
at the ends, a thing he had submitted to for the first time
in his life, but, on the whole, rather liked. The diamond
studs in his bosom glittered like fire-flies, and his watch-chain
coiled down his white vest like a golden serpent
hiding its head in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, my dear,” said Mrs. Carter, “just stand back
and let me look at you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Mrs. Carter, what have you got to say about it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mr. Carter put a thumb into each armhole of his
white vest, and posed himself superbly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter took a general observation, drew nearer,
smoothed the sleeves of his coat with her plump hand, and
observed that better-looking men might be found in the
great city of New York, but she had never set eyes on
them. At which Carter, being a little doubtful of himself,
blushed rosily, and attempted a dancing step, which proved
an ignominious failure, his boots being as tight as his coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear,” said Mrs. Carter, busying her hands with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the neck-tie again. “Do you know I’ve been thinking of
a pleasant surprise for you—a <i>very</i> pleasant surprise?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, Mrs. Carter, you have given me one in this
party, which I shan’t get over in six months. What is it
to be this time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A daughter—a full-grown, lovely daughter. What do
you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A full-grown, lovely daughter, Mrs. Carter? Well, I
think you are in want of a straight jacket more than I
am, and, after the party, this coat shall be made over to
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I am in earnest, husband!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So am I, wife, so much in earnest that I shouldn’t mind
giving up the coat now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have often talked of adopting a little girl since you
know when.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A flush came around Carter’s eyes—he turned away
from his wife.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be a trouble to bring one up, you know, dear.
Now supposing that done, and a girl came naturally into
the family about the age <i>she</i> might have been, wouldn’t you
rather like it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t thought about it, wife, have you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Carter, and you’ll see this girl to-night. I’ve given
you the idea, when you’ve seen her, just say if she wont be
like a sunbeam in the house?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like a what?” exclaimed Mr. Carter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter blushed and fanned herself nervously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It isn’t my idea, Carter; I found it in a magazine story,
and remembered it because it was so original.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let that go. If the girl was like a sunbeam, she’d
never get into our house, for fear of spoiling the carpets.
You’d be the first to shut her out, old woman!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old woman! I don’t like that, Carter. Look at me
with your own eyes, from head to foot, and say if you are
not ashamed of yourself?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Look at you? Well, I’m a doing it; but what on earth
have you done with all them things from Ball &#38; Black’s?
So far, I haven’t seen nothing but the bills. I thought you
wanted to cut a shine with them to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, so I did, but Ross thought I’d better not. You
know, Carter, that beauty unadorned looks better than overloading.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” said Carter, “at the magazines again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ross thinks so, at any rate, so I made myself simple
but elegant. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t know about that, Rebecca, but you’re an
all-fired good-looking woman, any how!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mr. Carter! all-fired, and just as people are coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it’s only between ourselves, Beccy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you might——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I mightn’t. What is it, Jacob?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Ross has come, sir, with the young lady, and wants
to know if he shall bring her up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered Carter, after a moment’s hesitation,
during which he was fitting on a cream-colored glove, with
all his might. “Take her into Mrs. Carter’s bouder. We’ll
be there in no time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jacob went out, and his master tugged away at the second
glove, which refused to meet at the wrist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Carter, <i>will</i> you give a little attention? This
confounded button.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, my dear, I know what it is, having suffered.
There.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The glove was closed so tightly that Carter’s wrist began
to swell above it, but the spirit of martyrdom was upon him,
and he marched out of his room without a word of complaint,
resolving to perform his social duties to the uttermost.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva Laurence was standing near the window of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>sumptuous little room. Her eyes had just fallen on Ruthy’s
pictures, framed in an exquisite net-work of gold, and the
pleasant surprise brightened her face with a smile that made
Carter hold his breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is the young lady,” said Mrs. Carter, going up to
Eva with a cordial welcome in her face. “Miss Laurence,
you have never seen my husband, but he has come to make
your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva turned and saw a rather stout and well-formed man
coming toward her, with his hand extended.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Delighted to see you, Miss—make yourself at home,
and welcome.” Eva, grateful for the warmth of his greeting,
laid her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very kind,” she said, modestly; “but Mr. Ross
told me I could expect nothing that was not pleasant here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Ross shall promise nothing for us that we will not
perform,” answered the host, blandly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear, that is a carriage—give me your arm. Ross,
take care of Miss Eva. Dear me, there is a party going up
to the dressing-room. What if we meet them!—oh, the
back stairs. They are a little dark, but I’ll go first. Carter,
take care of my train. Ah, this is something like!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br> <span class='large'>A GLIMPSE OF FAIRY LAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>No wonder Mrs. Carter gave voice to her admiration.
While she was in her dressing-room, chandeliers and wax-lights
enough to turn night into noonday, had been kindled
down the vista of three splendid rooms, separated from each
other only by rich, flowing draperies of silk and lace, varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and yet harmonious in their colors, as tints melt into
each other on a sunset cloud.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the far distance came the soft glow of milky amber,
stealing through transparent under-draperies, and throwing
a warm tinge over the pale sea-green of the middle room.
Here all the frescoes were delicate and subdued. Flowers
seemed to have cast their shadows on the ceilings; the
carpets were like snow, in which blossoms, in rich combinations,
were sinking. There all was delicate, artistic and
suggestive. Marble Floras, half the size of life, with one
arm full of roses, held back the draperies which fell tentlike
between the rooms. Adown the inner lace-folds,
flowers were so arranged that they seemed floating in frosty
air.</p>

<p class='c006'>At each window the same effect was produced. At one
a crouching Venus half hid herself in the snow-fall of the
curtains; at another, some dancing-girl peeped roguishly
out, as if looking for a partner.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this revealed by rainbows of light trembling down
from the cut-glass chandeliers, formed a picture which fairly
dazzled Eva Laurence, who stood in the crimson light of
the back room, lost and wondering, herself, unconsciously,
the most beautiful object present.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross, whose genius had created all this, looked on her
smiling. Never had his rare gifts wrought out greater
happiness to himself. It was like leading this young girl
into a paradise of his own creation; one, too, in which he
resolved that she should remain all her life, if it so pleased
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter gave one glance at the rooms, another to
make sure that they were still unoccupied, and flung her
arms about Ross, kissing him on both cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let them search, let them say what they please, they’ll
find nothing like shoddy here,” she said, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter was right. Never was the union of wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and genius more perfect in its work. The guests were
taken by surprise. Those who came with covert sneers,
forgot criticism in admiration. Everything was splendid,
everything complete.</p>

<p class='c006'>A legion of fairies could have devised nothing more
perfect. Nor was the effect diminished when the host and
hostess took their places; both were observant, subdued and
careful. Many of their guests had become suddenly rich
like themselves. The war, in its fearful levelization, had
given them plenty of company.</p>

<p class='c006'>If anything, Mrs. Carter was a little over zealous in her
hospitality. She presented Eva Laurence sometimes more
than once to the same guest. She was rather ostentatious
of her brother, but people were prepared to like him and
forgave that.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crowd grew denser and more brilliant as the evening
wore on; diamonds shamed the light from the chandeliers;
the glow of rich colors became almost oppressive. The
crowd scattered itself across the broad hall and into the
rooms beyond. In one there was dancing and such music
as makes the blood leap and thrill in young veins. Another
closed in the supper-tables, where servants were still at
work like bees in a flower-garden. The hum of sweet
voices, the chime of suppressed laughter, the flash of some
witty reply gave zest and piquancy to the scene.</p>

<p class='c006'>At first Eva was half frightened. She felt like a bird
fluttering in a gilded cage. The scene was unlike anything
she had ever witnessed, and her own share in it seemed like
a fraud. More than once she was presented to the very
persons who had commanded her services at the warerooms.
Some of the lace floating around those superb dresses had
passed through her hands. She felt keenly the look of
surprise with which she was occasionally regarded, and
wished herself at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can it mean?” “Is she a relative?” “How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>strange!” Eva heard these low-toned observations frequently;
her sensitive ear was keenly on the alert for them.
She felt alone in that wilderness of people.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>FIGHTING ANGUISH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Among the last of the guests was Mrs. Lambert, with
Ivon and Miss Spicer. The lady had lost something of her
usual graceful repose, and her eyes shone excitedly under
the light of her clustering diamonds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross was speaking in a low voice to Eva when this lady
came up to pay her respects to the hostess. An expression
of tender interest was on his face, and the girl answered it
with a grateful smile. The woman’s heart stopped beating;
a deadly faintness seized upon her. For a moment she went
blind; voices greeted her on all sides; she could not move
through a throng like that without pausing every moment
to receive the homage of her satellites. But this evening
she passed on, hearing nothing, seeing nothing but those
two faces.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still the habit of society was upon its queen. Her salutations
had their usual grace, she spoke blandly to the
hostess and the host, bent her head to Ross, and ignored
Eva utterly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl blushed, and felt the pain of coming tears, for
Ivon Lambert was with his mother. Would he too repudiate
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>No, the young man bent before her as if she had been a
princess, and would have spoken, but Mrs. Lambert, who
leaned on his arm, turned abruptly away. He felt the
shiver that ran through her frame, and saw the diamonds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>on her bosom heave and fall, as if she panted for breath.
Others noticed how pale she was, and detected the delicate
shade of rouge, thrown into relief by that pallor—a thing
they had never dreamed of before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon led the lady to a sofa, around which her friends
thronged, full of anxious inquiries, each concealing a compliment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was nothing,” the lady said, her foot had slipped in
getting out of the carriage, and gave her pain for a moment.
That was all.</p>

<p class='c006'>This really seemed to be true. The lady had a strong
will and indomitable pride. The blood came back to her
face fresh and vivid, her eyes grew bright as stars. She,
who seldom went beyond a smile, laughed now a low, sweet
laugh, that penetrated the crowd with an under cadence
that thrilled it. No young girl ever felt the storm of jealousy
like that. The maturity of passion was there, breaking
through all power of concealment.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crowd did not care to search for the cause of this
brilliant animation, or some one there might have read that
proud heart, in all its fire and pain, and she could not have
helped it. As it was, her lips had never been so eloquent,
her figure so gracefully impressive. The circle around her
was lost in admiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer seized upon young Lambert in her usual
abrupt fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come!” she said, “madame has no need of us, she has
become a fixed star, and I’m tired to death of revolving.
Mrs. Carter has got to introduce me to the great genius.
Everybody says he is so charming, so distinguished and
inaccessible—none of the girls can get a smile from him;
but I shall, you may bet high on that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon suffered himself to be dragged back to the great
drawing-room; for he hoped now to speak with Eva; but
just as he reached the place where she had been standing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Ross led her into the crowd. Miss Spicer saw her intended
prey move off, and began to reproach Ivon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There he goes! and that creature on his arm! I wonder
if he wants a shawl tried on. Such innovations! As
if the Carters hadn’t enough of a pull to get themselves
into society, but they must attempt to empty Broadway of
its shop-girls!”</p>

<p class='c006'>By this time Miss Spicer was near the hostess, whom
she addressed with vigor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Carter, I have got such a quarrel with you. When
am I to be introduced to that brother of yours? Can’t you
see that I’m half in love with him already; a dozen of us
quarreling which shall be first—genius is so uncommon and
so enticing. Is it true, Mrs. Carter, that you mean to give
him lots of money? People say so; but that’s of no consequence
to such of us as can afford to do as we please—for
genius, after all, isn’t half so common as money. But when
am I to be introduced?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” said Mrs. Carter, delighted. “If you had only
come a minute sooner! He just went away with Miss Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes! I saw it. That shop-girl—I beg ten thousand
pardons! but truth is truth—has carried him off! Now
tell me, how did she happen to get here? Lots of us girls
are dying to know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter drew herself up with some degree of dignity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you speak of Miss Laurence,” she said, “her father
was my brother’s old friend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“An old friend? Why, he was nothing but a policeman.
I have taken pains to inquire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still he was an honest and honorable man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Every inch of him,” said Carter, stoutly. “My roof
covers no better man to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As for the young lady,” joined in Mrs. Carter, taking
fresh courage, “she is likely to become nearer to us than a
friend. Isn’t that so, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Carter hesitated a moment, feeling as if his wife had entrapped
him into a premature compliance with her wishes;
but he spoke at last, resolutely enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Mrs. C., there is no harm in saying that, if Ross
stands his chance for a share of my property, the young
lady will enjoy it equally with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer pursed up her lips till they almost emitted a
whistle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, that’s the way the wind blows,” she said. “Wont
it be fun to tell the girls!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Spicer, we are keeping Mrs. Carter’s guests from
her,” said Ivon, observing a couple fighting their way
through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just like me, always in somebody’s path!” exclaimed
the girl, drawing back, but still keeping near the hostess.
“Mercy on me! who are those people? Stupendous! Do
look!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br> <span class='large'>MR. AND MRS. SMITH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The two people were Mr. and Mrs. Smith, she in the
glory and amplitude of her moire antique, with the yellow
feather in her hair—an addition Kate Gorman had insisted
on with spirit, declaring that no mistress of hers was to be
put down by them Laurence girls while she was to the fore.</p>

<p class='c006'>So with her feather all afloat, and her dress sweeping out
gorgeously, Mrs. Smith came up and dropped a voluminous
curtsy before her old friend, who stooped down, like a
queen, and, with both hands, lifted the grocer’s wife out of
the depths of her obeisance. Then Carter and Smith shook
hands, and said, “How do you do?” with solemn gravity,
while their wives dropped into conversation about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>children at home; and Miss Spicer hovered near, taking
venomous mental notes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, my! this is fun alive!” said the young lady. “I
only wish your mother had been here to see that curtsy.
Wasn’t it sublime? I’ve seen girls making cheeses before
this, but a grown woman, and stout at that, is excruciating!
Do take me away, Ivon; or I shall do something dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Young Lambert gladly led the girl back to his mother,
who still occupied her place on the sofa, and had increased
her circle of admirers. Miss Spicer took a vacant place by
her friend, who was talking brilliantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mrs. Lambert, do stop one minute, and hear what
I’ve got to tell you,” whispered the young lady, impatient
to impart her news.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert turned from the gay throng around her
and listened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is going to marry her!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He? Who?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The color left Mrs. Lambert’s lips as she asked the question,
and a cold shiver ran over her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who? Why Ross, the genius—Mrs. Carter’s brother.
He is going to marry that Laurence girl. Mrs. Carter
told me so herself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She told you so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman’s voice was low and hoarse; those who had
listened to her a minute before would not have known it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and her husband repeated it; he is going to give
them all his money in the end. Isn’t it disgusting!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did they tell you this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed they did. He is with her now. I saw them
going toward the dancing-room.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert arose, took the arm of a gentleman nearest
her, and moved toward the dancers. She did not speak,
could not, in fact, for a band seemed tightening about her
throat.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Over the black-walnut floor, with its mosaic border of
satin-wood circling the room a yard deep, a maze of dancers
were whirling in and out, swaying gracefully to the music,
as young trees bend to the wind. Among them was Ross
and Eva Laurence, her hand was upon his shoulder, his arm
circled her waist, yet scarcely touched it. He was still in the
prime of manly beauty, and the girl was loveliness itself.
She was dancing with all the spirit and grace of one to
whom the exercise was a delightful novelty; and he seemed
to feel the glow of her happiness in every nerve of his body.
When they rested, he stooped over her lovingly, and smiled
as she lifted her eyes to his. If ever exquisite tenderness
softened a human face, the woman who watched his so
eagerly, saw it there.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh! how she hated that girl! With what bitter despair
she gazed on the man.</p>

<p class='c006'>A sort of fascination possessed Mrs. Lambert; she lingered
in the room, and seemed absorbed by a scene that had
long since ceased to interest her; but her observation was
fixed on one couple; she saw every look, watched every
motion with a strange gleam in her eyes, and an ominous
compression of her lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last the music ceased, and Ross was leading his partner
to a seat, when Ivon Lambert came up and claimed her.
Then her face changed like a rose suddenly struck by the
sunshine; a delicate glow swept over it; her eyes drooped
when his hand touched her waist; she leaned toward him
as a flower bends on its stalk.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert saw this and drew a deep breath.
“Youth,” she whispered to herself, “turns to youth. I
will not believe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert turned and saw that Ross stood beside her.
She drew her hand from the gentleman who had led her
to the room, bent her head in dismissal, and touched Ross
upon the arm.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Did he shrink, or was that a thrill of pleasure that followed
her touch? She would have given the world to
know. Her hand grew bolder and laid itself on his arm.
He yielded to its pressure, and moved away.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a wing of the mansion was a conservatory full of
flowering plants, and lighted with lamps that swung to and
fro among the flowers, like mammoth pearls all on fire.
Towards this place Mrs. Lambert led her companion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XL.<br> <span class='large'>OLD LOVERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They stood under the shade of a tall drooping tree, starred
with soft, yellow blossoms, that rose out of a little jungle
of tropical plants in one end of the conservatory. Around
them was the soft glow of moonlight, literally shed from
alabaster lamps.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the distance came subdued bursts of music, and close
by a fountain sent its diamond drops through the neighboring
blossoms, and their bell-like tinkle sounded clear and silvery
as they fell upon the tesselated marble of the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all places on earth, this was the brightest for a meeting
of lovers. But these two persons had grey hairs upon
their temples, and a look of such unutterable pain in their
faces that all this perfume, and the musical fall of water-drops,
seemed but a mockery of something that had been.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You wished to speak with me,” said Herman Ross in a
low, sad voice. “I think we are alone here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Herman!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man started. Something in the tone of Mrs. Lambert’s
voice, as she uttered the name, sent a pang through
his whole system. Still he seemed calm, and his voice
changed but little when he spoke again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Is there anything you wish to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross asked this question earnestly, and his eyes dwelt on
the troubled face of the woman with almost imploring earnestness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anything I wish to tell?” repeated the lady, with a
startled look. “What could I have, that you do not
already know? I—I wished rather to ask a question?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I am here and have nothing to conceal.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! how coldly you speak, Herman!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How else should I speak, Mrs. Lambert?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know—I ought not to care; but I do—I do!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman spoke with anguish; she did not weep, but
there was something more thrilling than tears in her voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There was a time when I believed you,” said Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was when I had a right to ask. Then you would
have believed me against the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I would have believed you against the whole
world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But now——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I believe nothing, without proof.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I will believe you, asking no better proof than
your bare word.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman hesitated. In her first passion she had
thought it an easy thing to question him; but his chilling
calm daunted her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman, tell me, and, oh! let it be truth! Do you love
that girl?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman clasped her hands, and wrung them together
as she spoke. Ross looked at her a moment in grave
silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose you mean Miss Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I mean her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You ask if I love her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes! Oh, tell me!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Ross paused a moment, but he did not remove his eyes
from the woman’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you never speak?” she cried, passionately.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You ask if I love this girl, and I answer. Is there any
reason against it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do! You do! And almost confess it to me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To you, above all other persons, I deny any right to
question me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right! I have no rights; only it would be merciful if
you would set my mind at rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do not wish to answer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, God help me! This is hard!” cried the woman,
looking wildly around, as if a power of help lay in the
beautiful shrubs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this conscience?” said Ross, bending his eyes
sternly upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Conscience! Conscience!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Madam, once for all, if you have anything to confess——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To confess!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert’s face was white as snow; her lips grew
cold, and her voice failed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Confess, or confide. I am willing to use the softer
term,” answered Ross, touched, in spite of himself, by those
contracted features.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I have nothing to confess, or confide—nothing!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross turned away, bitterly disappointed. Something he
had evidently hoped to learn from the lady, which she either
did not understand, or purposely avoided.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ask you a question, vital to us both, and you refuse to
answer,” said the lady, still clasping her hands, where the
jewels shone, and cut into the tender flesh unnoticed, in
her agony of impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“First,” said Ross, sternly, “I will ask you a question.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, you will answer mine? Ask it! Ask it!” cried
the lady.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Ross gave a glance around, as if fearing that they were
not quite alone, then he took the woman’s two hands in his,
drew her, not unwillingly, toward him, and whispered a few
words. She uttered a low cry, wrung her hands from his
clasp, and stood mute and pale, gazing on him with a wild
gleam in her eyes, that shone like madness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you mad, or am I?” she exclaimed at last, pressing
both trembling hands on her bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The time of madness for me has long since passed,”
said Ross; “but you have not answered my question.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Answered your question! No, then! No, no! A
thousand times no! I—I——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the lady fell to trembling violently; for there was a
look of-unbelief in the man’s face, that struck her to the
heart, and he turned to leave her in silence. Then the old
idea shot through her brain, and she approached him closer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have answered you. Now answer me. Do you love
this girl, Eva Laurence!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross spoke in a low distinct voice, which scarcely rose
above the fall of water-drops in the fountain; but it seemed
to fill the whole conservatory. The flowers, the water, and
the moon-like lamps, had heard it with herself, and seemed
to rejoice over it—triumph over her. The last hope went
out from her heart then, and she believed herself to be
dying.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLI.<br> <span class='large'>IVON AND EVA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A handsomer couple than Ivon Lambert and Eva Laurence
never measured perfect happiness to music. Tall,
graceful, thrilled with a glow of unspoken love, they fairly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>floated through the ball-room, which was soon crowded with
a circle of curious admirers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The beauty of this unknown girl had created a wide
sensation among Mr. Carter’s guests—a sensation intensified
by the hints and jeers flung out by Miss Spicer, who felt
herself relieved of a rival, and, next to conquest, loved that
species of piquant gossip that approaches a scandal. That
young lady had been busy as a humming-bird, in a wild
trumpet vine, circulating all that she knew of Eva Laurence—her
origin, her occupation, and her engagement to the
greatest genius just then in fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this time Eva, unconscious of the general interest,
was dancing more than was proper for a betrothed young
lady, with Ivon Lambert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Who was this girl? Was she really engaged? Had
she, in fact, on her very first appearance, enthralled the two
men most sought after in fashionable circles? A shop-girl,
with that air of grace and refinement? Impossible!
That, at least, must be one of Miss Spicer’s canards. Why,
in every respect, this girl had all the qualifications of a
Reigning Belle.</p>

<p class='c006'>These were only a few of the whispered comments that
went around the circle, as these young people moved
harmoniously among the dancers, unconscious of the general
attention bestowed upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the pause of the dance, Ivon noticed the cluster of
flowers that bloomed upon his partner’s bosom. Eva
blushed when she saw where his eyes were directed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You accepted them,” he said, with a smile, “without
knowing how many wild thoughts were bound up with the
blossoms. Had you dreamed of those thoughts, I fear my
violets would not have rested on that bosom now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva looked down at her flowers, that rose and fell
suddenly, as if they had been cast on the snowy crest of a
wave, then she lifted her eyes to his—a single glance, and
the white lids drooped again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Ivon smiled, and his eyes flashed. He required no better
answer than that one look. His arm stole around her waist
again. Now the thrill of assured sympathy lent them
wings. No two birds in mid heaven were ever more alone,
or gave themselves up so entirely to the grace of motion.
They seemed literally floating on the music.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the band stopped, Eva drew a deep, deep sigh—the
abrupt silence dragged her out of heaven so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Earlier in the evening Ivon had seen the glow of flowers,
amid softly-shaded lamps, in a vista, from the great drawing-room,
and led Eva gently that way. As for the girl,
the whole scene was fairy land to her, and all places alike,
while he was by her side. She was quite unconscious of
the admiration, the gossip, and conjectures that followed
her, as she was led through the crowd; equally unmindful
of the vast social distance which lay between her position,
and that of the young man whose attentions had drawn all
eyes upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Adam never led Eve into a lovelier nook of Paradise,
than the little world of flowers in which the girl at last
found herself. Everything was quiet there, even the soft
tinkle and low, mellow sound of water-drops, as they rained
over the marble floor, and pattered on the broad-leaved
plants that floated on the fountain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two stood together in silence. The sound of a voice,
even in its lowest love-tones, would have broken up the exquisite
harmony of the place. Her hand lay upon his arm;
he took it in his own, and held it tenderly, as if it had been
a flower, and looked into her downcast face, which had been
etherealized in the lamp light.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva!”</p>

<p class='c006'>His voice was low and deep, scarcely rising above the
sweet noise of the fountain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva looked up suddenly; then her eyes fell to the marble
floor, where the red petals of an over-ripe rose had dropped
and lay glowing like rubies.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Eva, can you imagine—have you ever dreamed how
much I love you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her hand trembled in his. She caught one of the red
rose-leaves, as it was quivering downward, and dropped it
again, with a sigh of infinite happiness. Another leaf
lodged upon her lip, and for an instant trembled there,
scarcely redder or sweeter than the mouth it touched. Ivon
stooped down, and with his lips gathered the leaf from hers.
She made no resistance; but drew closer to him, and the
clasp of her fingers grew warm and tender.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One word, Eva; only one. May I love you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She lifted her eyes to his. The light of stars seemed
quivering in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can you ask me? Have I not permitted it already?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man drew her gently to his bosom, and laid
his cheek to hers, as doves creep together in a nest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A thousand times better than myself,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And some day, not long from this, you will be my
wife?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c012'>His wife. Eva had not thought of that. It had been
enough that he loved her, and she loved him. Now an idea
of the future flashed through her happiness, and she remembered
how far they two were apart. His wife! The holy
word thrilled her from head to foot with unutterable bliss,
mingled with apprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah!” she said, “what a strange, sweet word it is.
How much it means; how impossible that I should bear it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“It is the sweetest possibility on earth, my Eva; one
that I have had in my heart of hearts since we first met.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How strange,” murmured the girl. “But you are so
fearless. I never dared look so far.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But now, my girl, now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon threw his arms around her drooping figure, and
kissed her with passionate warmth.</p>

<p class='c006'>A woman had been lying insensible back of a little jungle
of broad-leaved tropical plants, out of which a slender
tree rose to the glass roof. The coldness of the marble,
and some stray drops that reached her from the fountain,
brought her back to life, when she heard the low murmur of
voices close by, and arose to leave the conservatory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The place where Ivon and Eva stood was sheltered from
sight by the plants that concealed this lady; but through
the leaves she saw the girl’s face, bathed in blushes, as it
escaped from the first kisses of love—and the look of
intense happiness that flushed it, stung her to the soul.
One man alone was in her thoughts, and his supposed presence
there, while she lay stricken lifeless, by the cruel truth
he had told her, was maddening.</p>

<p class='c006'>A stir among the plants drew Eva’s attention that way.
She saw a pair of white arms flung upward, on which great
jewels flashed in the moonlight of the lamps, and shrunk
away from Ivon, passing to the other side of the fountain,
startled and ashamed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Ivon could speak or follow her, Mrs. Lambert
rushed by the fountain, and, seizing Eva by the arm, looked
fiercely into her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never, never, while you and I live, shall you marry
that man! Girl, remember that I have warned you!
Speak to him—look at him again at your peril! Some
things are impossible—this is one. Turn those eyes from
my face—never dare to look at me again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Like a storm, the woman had burst upon Eva; her face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>was as white as snow; her colorless lips trembled. The
diamonds quivering with fire on her throat and head, were
less brilliant than her wild, fierce eyes. Before Eva could
speak, or Ivon move, she had swept out of the conservatory,
without casting a look on the young man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It—it is your mother!” said Eva, as Ivon came toward
her; so astonished by this outburst in a woman whose self-control
had been perfect all the years he had known her,
that surprise had kept him motionless.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, “it is my mother; but so changed, so
fearfully transfigured, that I scarcely recognized her. She
seemed to threaten you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She did threaten me; her eyes were fierce with hate.
What have I done that she should assail me so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have the angels done? I do not understand this,
Eva. It is unlike Mrs. Lambert, who is usually so proud
and cold, scarcely deigning to express her own wishes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She heard all we said, and it drove her wild. Oh, her
face was terrible!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I scarcely knew it. If she heard all, it was the suddenness
that overwhelmed her. But she is generous.
When you are my wife——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah!” said Eva, drawing away from him. “How is it
possible? I have no right here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why have you no right, Eva?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The poor have no rights in a place like this,” answered
the girl, looking wildly around. “I have been dreaming!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be your fault, and my eternal misfortune, if this
dream does not last for life,” said Ivon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva shook her head. Her brief trance of happiness was
broken up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I will have it so,” persisted Ivon, passionately.
“On all the earth there is not another woman who shall be
my wife.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let us go now,” answered Eva, sadly. “Your mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>will be watching. I should have remembered her look,
when she first saw me standing by Mrs. Carter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But for that I might not have said here and now, that
no man living ever loved a woman as I love you,” said
Ivon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva lifted her eyes; they were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall never forget that you wished to atone for her
injustice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Atone! Girl, I love you devotedly, madly. She knows
it. I have told her so. And you love me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva dashed the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I love you so well that nothing shall induce me to
degrade you, by an unsuitable or unauthorized marriage.
Your mother——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My mother is dead long ago! This lady was my
father’s wife; kind and generous as any real mother could
be, till now. I have never wished to dispute her authority;
but here it must end!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To that, no act of mine shall tempt you,” said Eva.
“I see now how vain and unwise it was to accept this
invitation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva, how wild and unkind all this is! A moment
ago I was supremely happy. Now the violence of a lady,
who has, in fact, no authority over us, is enough to turn you
against me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said Eva, “if she had not aroused me with such
cruel violence, it must have come to the same thing. I
have no part in this scene, no place among the more fortunate
women who grace it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you have a place in my heart, Eva.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know it; but that is a misfortune which I have
brought upon you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A misfortune! It is my glory. Understand me, Eva.
From this night, you are my betrothed wife. Nothing shall
separate us; no, not even your own proud will.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Eva smiled, but the smile was more pathetic than tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, if my will were all!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That, going with me, girl, no power on earth shall reach
us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His courage and his ardor failed to inspire her. She had
been cruelly wounded, and the pride she was scarcely
conscious of, armed her against him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me go now,” she said, preparing to leave the
conservatory.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not till you have promised; not till your dear lips have
once answered mine,” he replied, straining her to his bosom
again, spite of her breathless protest. “Leave everything
to me. Have no fear that your womanly dignity will suffer,
or that I shall yield one jot of the independence that
belongs to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva had no heart to answer. She withdrew herself
gently from his arms, and moved toward the door, pale and
trembling; for, to her, it was a final parting. He followed
her haughty and resolute.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIII.<br> <span class='large'>HERSELF AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva took refuge with Mrs. Carter, who still maintained
her post in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you tired, Eva? Has anything happened to
distress you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva turned, and saw Mr. Ross, whose low, fatherly voice
was like a balm to her wounded self-love.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am a little tired, and all this bewilders me,” Eva
replied, lifting her troubled eyes to his. “Ah, Mr. Ross, I
have no real place here.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“That is to be decided,” said Ross. “Come with me to
the supper-room. A glass of wine will do no harm here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross was about to lead her away, when she uttered a faint
exclamation, and clung nervously to his arm. Mrs. Lambert
was making her way toward the hostess, and the very sight
of her sent the proud blood to Eva’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c006'>Proud, graceful, and entirely herself again, Mrs. Lambert
swept up to Mrs. Carter. She had drained more than one
glass of champagne, at the supper-table, where the sparkle
of her wit, and the hitherto unknown sound of her laughter,
had entranced and dazzled her admirers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never,” they all said, “had the queen of fashion shone
out with such wonderful splendor. Something must have
inspired her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something had inspired her, more potent than admiration,
more fiery than wine; the burning pangs of jealousy,
added to a cruel defeat, where she had staked her very soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Smiling, bland, and wonderfully beautiful, she came up to
say farewell. Ross did not attempt to retreat, but waited
her approach with dignified calmness. He felt Eva’s hand
tremble on his arm, but could not comprehend the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert did not attempt to ignore the girl then,
but passed from the hostess, and took leave of her with ironical
politeness, which was extended to Ross, who received it
with a grave bow. For once in many years the lady had
given way to overwhelming passion; but her will was
strong, and habit aided her in concealing the pangs that
had stricken her lifeless in the conservatory.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the restraint she had forced upon herself was beyond
endurance. She neither waited for Ivon or Miss Spicer,
but accepted the first offered arm, went through the ceremony
of leave-taking with fortitude, though the two persons
she most loved and hated, stood by the hostess, and gayly
bade good-night to her escort, as she entered her carriage.</p>

<p class='c006'>When once alone, the passions, so long held in restraint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>broke forth vehemently. The woman wrung her hands,
fell upon her knees, and, burying her face in the silken
cushions of her carriage, sobbed, moaned, and writhed, with
a force of anguish that threatened her very life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meantime, Miss Spicer had found Ivon in the crowd
and captured him at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where on earth is Mrs. Lambert? I have been searching
and searching for her. She was at the supper-table
one minute; but before I could fight my way to her, she
was gone. One might as well have no chaperon at all, as
wander about in this wild fashion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We shall soon find my mother,” said Ivon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, by the crowd that surrounds her. I wonder if she
will ever give up her place as a reigning belle? It looks
to-night as if that shop-girl were going to step in! Ten
thousand pardons; I forget that she was a special friend of
yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean Miss Laurence. She is a friend that I am
proud to own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you will not own her long, as Miss Laurence, let
me tell you. What luck some people have! She is engaged.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed! Since when, and to whom?” said Ivon, indifferently,
for he had no faith in Miss Spicer’s sources of
information.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know when; but the man I am certain of. It
is Mr. Ross.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Ross!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon was aroused now; the very name startled him.
Other thoughts crowded in. Why had the Carters taken
such sudden interest in the girl? Why had she accepted
his declaration of love, but so resolutely refused his hand?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has the news struck you dumb?” exclaimed Miss
Spicer, with a short laugh. “One would think so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Idle gossip, Miss Spicer, seldom has that power over
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Gossip! Why, the engagement is declared. I got it
from Mrs. Carter herself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the gospel. Ask her yourself. She doesn’t seem
ashamed of the match, but presents the girl to any one that
comes up. Disgusting, isn’t it. As if she had not trouble
enough to get into society herself, without that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In his anxiety Ivon had turned toward the drawing-room,
which Mrs. Lambert had just left. At the door he met the
gentleman who had placed her in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! I have discovered you at last,” he said, addressing
Miss Spicer. “Mrs. Lambert has gone home. She desired
me to say that the carriage would be sent back for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The idea!” exclaimed that young lady, casting a significant
glance at Ivon. “Does she expect us to ride home
alone? People will say that we are engaged.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very naturally,” answered the gentleman; at which
Miss Spicer struck him with her fan, exclaiming again,
“The idea!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The gentleman passed on, laughing pleasantly. Ivon and
his companion entered the great drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There they stand now! Does that look like an engagement?”
cried the young lady. “Watch their faces, see
her eyes. What an artful way she has of lifting them—practises
at the counter, I suppose. Do you believe me
now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer used her own eyes as she spoke, and saw that
Ivon was deadly pale. Still, she had no mercy on him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There! See how he bends over her! What expression!
What tender interest one can read in his face! No wonder
she looks at him so earnestly. He is the handsomest man
I have seen this year, spite of a few grey hairs. Rich, too,
or will be; for the Carters mean to give them everything.
Isn’t she in a good run of luck?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon did not answer, but led his companion to the mistress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of the house, and went through the ceremony of leave-taking
quietly, and as if nothing had happened; but his face
was colorless, and the hand which touched Eva’s in parting,
was cold as stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, one would think the girl had rejected you, by the
color of your face,” said Miss Spicer, as Ivon went with her
from the room. He answered her very quietly,</p>

<p class='c006'>“She has rejected me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br> <span class='large'>CLOSING THE SHUTTERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jared Boyce had a taste for society, and managed to
enjoy a good deal of it from the side-walk and park-benches
wherein he could get an hour or two in the day-time, or
close the grocery early enough to witness the outgoings or
incomings of a fashionable party at night. Of course, this
great entertainment at the Carters had been the excitement
of the week in that corner store. Innumerable were the
errands Boyce had run to milliners, thread needle stores,
and apothecaries, in behalf of his mistress, who was so completely
absorbed in her preparations, that she generally forgot
to count the change brought back from these little excursions—a
circumstance out of which he had made considerable
profit.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the eventful night, Boyce was as busy as a bee running
up and down stairs, crossing the street for yards of ribbon,
or papers of pins, holding consultations with Kate Gorman,
and haunting the stables to make certain that the carriage
would come in time. Now and then he got a glimpse
of the mistress, who made a general dressing-room of the
whole second floor, and betrayed the progress of her toilet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>more frequently than she was conscious of. At such times
Boyce would lean forward, with a hand on each knee, and
exclaim, in the fullness of his admiration,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, my! Isn’t that dress agoing to put down the hull
bilen of ’em. If there’s a more stupendous lady than she’ll
be, I’d like to see her a going to the party, that’s all.
Jim’s sister to think of evening herself agin us. White
pigeons agin peacocks, with moons on their spread feathers!
Bosh!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith heard these exclamations with no little elation;
and Kate Gorman repeated them, with Hibernian improvements,
that fairly took the good woman off her feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was an important moment when Mrs. Smith descended
to the store, with her red moire antique gathered up in
voluminous folds around her person, and a huge bouquet in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Boyce heard her step on the stairs, he fell to work
at once, removed baskets of fruit, butter-tubs and fish-barrels
from their places, and widened a safe passage for the
gorgeous dress, which passed through, as it were, with a
rustle and flutter of acknowledgment. This the mistress
intensified, by a world of gracious thanks, and permission to
close the store immediately after ten. This was exactly
what Boyce had been aiming at, having made a private
arrangement to go out with Kate Gorman.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moment Smith’s carriage drove off, Boyce took authority
on himself, and summoned James to action.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come along here and help put up the shutters. Haul
them baskets inside, and don’t stuff your pockets full of
cranberries, while you’re a doing it. I know yer tricks, old
feller, so look sharp, if you want me to hold my tongue.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James had just seen his sister come forth in her soft
white raiment, and fresh flowers, on her way to the party,
and felt some resentment at the disparaging remarks Boyce
made about her. But he knew well enough that words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>would be of no avail with the young tyrant, and obeyed
him in angry silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few minutes the shutters were closed, and even the
coal-bin, which projected on the side-walk, was safely fastened.
When this was done, Boyce led the way up stairs,
and met Kate Gorman at the landing, with her shawl and
bonnet on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re asleep at last,” she said, “all but Jerusha
Maria; she holds out like a trooper, for the sight of that
red dress just drove her wild, and she keeps snatching at the
yeller feather yet. I gave her a double dose of paregoric,
and got her under a little; but she’s wide awake yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just in time,” Boyce broke in. “We shall have a good
look at the whole crowd. Jimmy will take care that the
young ones don’t fall out of bed. Just you go in there, old
feller, and see that you stick to your post, and hold that
precious little girl in your arms till she crows herself to
sleep. It’s just the work for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll go in, of course, because some one must take care
of her,” said James; “but it’s too early to close up, and
you have no business to go out so soon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So soon,” cried Kate Gorman, tying her bonnet with an
angry jerk. “Look at the clock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James did look at the little time-piece, in its square
mahogany case, and was astonished to see that it only
wanted a few minutes of ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kate gave Boyce a knowing wink, and made a swift
motion with her fingers, as if turning the pointers of a
clock, which he understood, and answered with an approving
nod.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not just yet,” said Boyce, as James was going into the
sleeping-room where Jerusha Maria was making vigorous
efforts to get out of her cradle. “You’ve got to go down,
and lock us out. I’m not a going to carry a heavy key
about in my pocket. Besides, safe bind and safe find is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>motto. So make sure you don’t go to sleep with the baby,
for we depend on you to let us in, and so will the other
party.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James made no answer, but took the key that Boyce held
out, and followed the two down stairs. The store was dark
as midnight, for the shutters were firmly closed, and the
candle which James carried, only gave out a faint circle of
light, by which the clerk and housemaid found their way
into the street.</p>

<p class='c006'>James closed the door after them, locked it, and looked
around for an iron bar, that usually stood back of the door,
ready for the two staples sunk into the woodwork on either
side. It was not to be seen. The boy held down his light,
and searched for it in every place he could think of, but in
vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boyce has flung it down somewhere, moving the things
about,” he thought, a little anxiously. “It was awful
careless of him; but there’s no need of it. The lock is
strong enough, and I’m not likely to go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just then the little girl up stairs gave an impatient yell,
which drove all ideas of the bar out of the lad’s mind;
with the key in his hand, he rushed up stairs, calling out
cheerfully to the little night-hawk as he went.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the next half hour James was busy carrying that
spoiled child up and down the room, while she tugged viciously
at his hair, sobbed, shrieked, and kicked her tiny feet
against his chest, until even her unnatural energy gave out,
and she fell asleep in his tired arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the stealthy tread of a cat, and holding his breath,
James laid the child in its crib, and sat down completely
tired out. He had been busy all day, and excitement had
taken away his appetite. He was not hungry now, but
found his throat dry, and a feverish thirst upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>A pitcher of root beer stood on the table, with a tumbler,
from which Boyce had drank before going out. The bottle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of paregoric, brought from the druggist’s that afternoon,
was on the window-sill close by, almost empty.</p>

<p class='c006'>James took up the tumbler, filled it, and drank eagerly.
It seemed a little strong, but he thought nothing of that
until he noticed the vial on the window. Then he fancied
a taste of paregoric in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose they dropped the spoon into the glass, after
the baby had done with it,” he thought. “But what a
jolly dose they must have given her. There isn’t a teaspoonful
left. How she will sleep, now that I’ve got her
down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy seated himself by the crib, and began to swing
it lightly to and fro, rather to keep himself busy, than from
any idea of its usefulness. After awhile his eyes grew
heavy, and his hand rested motionless on the crib. Then it
fell away altogether, and, seated in the Boston rocking-chair,
James slept as soundly as his little charge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once or twice the boy awoke with a start, as if some
noise had aroused him; but his head was heavy, and his
senses dull. Strive as he would to listen, sleep overpowered
him, and was more and more profound as the night wore on.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLV.<br> <span class='large'>WATCHING FROM THE PAVEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Meantime, Boyce and Kate Gorman were enjoying
themselves in a most aristocratic fashion, in front of Mrs.
Carter’s dwelling. They had taken a good position, and
saw the whole company, as carriage after carriage set down
its load. Once, for a very brief time, Kate missed her
companion, who had stepped back into the shadow of a
neighboring building, and spoke to a young man, who took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>something from his hand then slunk cautiously away.
Directly he disappeared entirely and was lost in the crowd
of curious persons, who had gathered to see what fashionable
life was like, when viewed from the side-walk, and by
gaslight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, me!” said Boyce, when Kate reproached him
for leaving her. “I haven’t been six feet away from you
all the evening. It was that big woman who stood between
me and you. I could have took hold of your dress any
minute; only you were enjoying yourself so much with
them last two carriage-loads, that I didn’t have the heart
to disturb you by saying I’m here, Miss Gorman, which I
was, though, not being the fellow to leave a lovely and
defenceless female alone in a crowd.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you’re not, Mr. Boyce,” said Kate, fully satisfied
that he had been close by her elbow all the time. “I
only did not see you just then, and, being a little timmersome
at night, the thought of your leaving me alone set me
all in a trimble.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the moment you spoke I was here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you were; only I didn’t observe it just at the
minute. But, oh! what has come over us now? Look
there! If she hasn’t brought down a handful of stars for
her head! Why, sure, it’s the queen herself!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a bit of it,” answered Boyce, with supreme contempt
of the idea. “She’s only a customer of ours. I’ve
had to carry home her groceries more than once, when that
boy Jim was out. That’s Mrs. Lambert.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Lambert,” repeated Kate, who had never heard
the name before, but was still wonderfully impressed by the
splendor of that lady’s dress. “Well, of course, you
know; only, if it was not for that, I should take her for
something a great deal more particular. Dear me! what a
blaze the house is in. How the curtains shake and tremble.
To think of Mr. and Mrs. Smith being in there, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>cream of the country, and I dressing her for the same! It’s
beyond belief, if we didn’t know it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Kate!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Boyce, that’s me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“After the carriages get a little thinner, suppose you and
I go down to the theatre?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The theatre, Mr. Boyce, wouldn’t that make us late
home?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, no. We could just drop into the Bowery, see
some of them fellows die fighting like fury, and then
get back time enough to see all this company come out
and go home. They’ve been having a good time; why
shouldn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“True for ye: but the child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Haven’t we left that boy Jim in full charge, and isn’t
he a capital nuss. Come now, what’s the odds! While
this swell-crowd is enjoying of itself with dancing and
champagne, oysters and ice cream, boned-turkey, and what
not, you and I are human creatures, with a right to live,
and have fun as well as them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is the truth, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, having the funds in my pocket, I am ready to stand
that amount, if you’re conformable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Boyce, I can’t say but I am willing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this, Kate Gorman took the clerk’s arm, and crossing
over to a street car, proceeded with him to the theatre.</p>

<p class='c006'>An hour or two later, the couple stood in front of Mr.
Carter’s dwelling again. The crowd had dispersed then,
and there seemed little to interest any person in the carriages
that crept up to the door, and, taking in a sleepy
freight of revelers, moved away. Still Boyce insisted that
the sight was one that he would not lose for the world,
and kept the weary girl standing there, until Mrs. Smith
appeared at the door, and, with fussy attention to her dress,
entered the hack that waited for her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>When this carriage drove away, Boyce expressed great
willingness to go home; and Kate, who had dropped half
asleep, moved away with him, heartily wishing herself in
bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. and Mrs. Smith drove, in a dreary, fatigued state,
toward their home. The occasion had been a proud one;
but even that could not make them quite insensible to the
late hour, and the discomfort of full dress, when the desire
for sleep lay heavy upon both.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the carriage stopped, Smith let himself out, and
waited to see his wife safe on the pavement. Then he gave
a heavy blow on the door with his clenched hand, waiting
afterward with some impatience for it to be opened.</p>

<p class='c006'>A full minute went by, and there was no sign of life in
the building. Then he gave another impatient blow, and
stepped back to see if any one was stirring in the second
story.</p>

<p class='c006'>A dim light shone through the blinds; but it seemed
stationary, and no one moved. Then Smith shouted, and,
taking up a block of wood, flung it viciously at his own
window. Evidently late hours did not agree with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, the light began to waver, and finally disappeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just then Boyce and Kate Gorman came up, much to
the astonishment of their employers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Kate Gorman, Jared Boyce! What does this
mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! nothing,” said Boyce, almost airily. “Only Kate
and I have been out on a little bender of our own. The
store and baby are all right; we left Jim Laurence locked
in with them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Mrs. Smith could reply, the grocery door was
opened, and James stood in the entrance with a lamp in his
hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLVI.<br> <span class='large'>AFTER THE PARTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The next morning after the ball Mr. Smith arose very
cross, and Mrs. Smith slept late, so late that Jerusha Maria
grew fearfully impatient, and, having slept off her liberal
share of the paregoric, wanted to have the usual rough and
tumble romp on her mother’s bed. This desire the drowsy
woman repulsed with a half-angry growl, that made the
child first open her eyes wide with astonishment, then fill
her mouth with indignant screams.</p>

<p class='c006'>This outcry James was expected to pacify, while Kate
Gorman got the breakfast in grim discontent, for she too
was suffering from want of sleep, and took vengeance on the
gridiron and coffee-mill, which she banged about viciously,
and ground with the fury of a Nemesis.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Smith eat his solitary breakfast, which was in
itself enough to sour any man’s temper, the coffee being
thick with grounds, and the fried potatoes bitter with
smoke, Boyce opened the store, and dragged forth his baskets
and boxes of merchandise under the sheltering awning; he
made a respectable display of vegetables left over from the
previous night, and fruit with a suspicion of decay creeping
through it; for Smith had slept too late for the early market
hour, and even his stock in trade felt the effect of that
one night’s advent into high life, the splendor of which had
demoralized his home.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it chanced that the store work came entirely to
Boyce, and that interesting child, with her screams, her
kicks, and wonderful capacity for hair-tugging, fell to
James, while Kate scolded, and Mrs. Smith slept.</p>

<p class='c006'>In vain the lad tried to hush the indignant young lady;
in vain he bent his head, and offered a splendid mass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>raven curls for her hands to revel in. Once or twice, I am
afraid, he was tempted to shake her soundly; in fact, he did
practice a little in that line, but ended it all in fun, and finished
by making up faces, that turned her continuous howl
into shrieks of laughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last Smith went down stairs, wondering if there was
no way of stopping that child’s noise, and wishing that he
were a woman with nothing to do but sleep till noon, contented
as a lamb, with an Irish girl slamming things about,
and a jerky child yelling Hail Columbia in his ears.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith was too soundly asleep to hear this sarcasm,
and the young lady aforesaid set up a new tune of offence,
feeling deeply wronged, when her father passed down stairs,
without an effort to appease her grief.</p>

<p class='c006'>James struggled under these difficulties with wonderful
patience; he tossed Miss Smith into the air till she caught
her breath like a sun-fish out of water. He set her down
in his lap, and trotted her to Boston, with the agility of a
race horse. He exhibited a pair of red morocco boots on
her own little feet, which filled her with a moment’s admiration,
and a burst of fervent laughter. He carried her to
the window, and pointed out her father, who was talking
with Boyce in front of the store, in an earnest and rather
excited manner, which did not at first strike him as singular,
as everybody was restless and excited that morning.
But there was something strange about Boyce, who seemed
to be talking in a low, eager way, and watching the thunder-cloud
on his employer’s face, with keen, sidelong glances,
that struck the lad who looked on as false and sinister.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even the child seemed to notice something strange about
her father, and stopped crying suddenly. For some unaccountable
reason the boy’s heart fell, and he watched the
two as they walked back into the store with a feeling of
vague apprehension. Why, a wiser person than himself
could not have told; for he had done no wrong, and had no
enemies, unless the young fellow, Boyce, was one.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>This was what had occurred in the store below. In the
hurry of preparation for Mrs. Carter’s party, a considerable
amount of money had been left in the desk, a circumstance
that seldom happened, and which Smith had always provided
against, by a deposit every afternoon. Before going
up to dress, he had locked the desk, and put the key in
his pocket, leaving it there when he changed his clothes.
When he went down in the morning, this money was gone,
and with it some of the more expensive portions of his
stock—two or three small boxes of choice tea, which bore
his private mark, and other articles, amounting to the
value of several hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, these things might have been removed from the
store by one person, but a horse and wagon must have been
used to carry them away, if they were taken any distance.
It had been considerably after nine the night before when
Smith and his wife started for the party. Boyce had gone
out with Kate Gorman directly after, as he confessed, having
been locked out by James Laurence, who retained possession
of the key. How then could this robbery have
taken place before ten.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kate Gorman had been about all the time, and so was
James, who was anxious, Boyce said, that the key should
be left with him. This was all that Boyce knew of the
matter. He and Kate Gorman had been together all the
time after they left the store, till they returned to it. Early
in the evening they had watched the guests going into the
Carter mansion; then they had been at the Bowery theatre.
In fact, every minute of his time could be accounted for.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the boy James, Boyce knew nothing about him, only
that he wanted to stay at home, that he was rather anxious
to keep the key, and had fastened the door after them when
he and Kate went out. Of course there was nothing wrong
about that. True, money had been missing in small sums
more than once; but thieves were adroit, and, in the hurry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of business, the money drawer was left exposed sometimes.
There was no reason to suspect James, because a few dollars
had been found missing now and then.</p>

<p class='c006'>But for these sagacious hints, perhaps, Mr. Smith never
would have suspected the boy. He knew how adroit burglars
could be, and his thoughts naturally turned in that
direction: but Boyce had managed to unite the boy with
this very idea. Burglars always have accomplices, he said,
frequently among the servant girls; but that could not be
true of Kate Gorman, who was honest as the day was long;
besides, she had been with him all the time. No, no, it
could not possibly be Kate Gorman, nor James. Things
might look a little squally in his direction; but the little
chap was true as steel; to suspect him was just nonsense.</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith said little. He was a shrewd, close man, who kept
his thoughts and his money very much to himself. He
questioned Boyce closely enough, and imbibed suspicious
conscientiously, that influenced his after action to a cruel
extent; but he came to no definite conclusion for that day
at least. This much he settled. Mrs. Smith was to know
nothing of the robbery; first, because discovery was not
likely to spring out of much talking, and again, because his
wife had warned him of danger in having so much money
in the store. Besides, what was the use of telling her?
Women were always Marplots in such affairs. No, no, he
would betake himself to a sharp detective, get the property
back, and then inform his wife. Fortunately, she would be
far too sleepy that day for any special interest in his affairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce was very willing to be silent; in fact he did not
take lovingly to the investigation, and was glad to be rid
of it; his face had been unusually pale from the first,
and he moved uneasily when Smith’s eyes were upon him,
as if the thought of having drawn suspicion on that young
boy were distressing him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not even to Kate Gorman did the grocer mention his loss;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>but he questioned her in a cautious way, and got full confirmation
of all that Boyce had said. After this, he went to
a detective, and set him on the alert.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLVII.<br> <span class='large'>HOW MISS SPICER AND ELLEN POST FRATERNIZE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>That day Boyce carried some groceries to Mrs. Lambert’s
kitchen. He was very intimate in that region, especially
with Robert the footman; who had a face not unlike
his own, and hair of the same brick-dust hue, a tint
that Ellen Post admired exceedingly. In fact, the waiting maid’s
fancy did not stop there, but took in the five feet ten
of the footman’s entire person. For his sake, she gave a
little lofty patronage to Boyce, though it was a thorn in her
side that Robert’s influence had been brought to bear on
the cook in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all, society is like a tangle of wild vines, it is impossible
to separate the fruit from the leaves that breathe
for it. What society is in the mass, families are in detail.
Each member has an important influence on the others.
The mistress of a household would often be shocked, if she
dreamed how completely she is the tool and puppet of a
servant, with more brains and less money than herself; or
how completely her most sacred thoughts are criticised and
discussed in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some days Miss Spicer had been staying with Mrs.
Lambert, who was far from well, and kept her room, refusing
to see any one but this girl, who brought her news from
their outer world, and talked with her continually on the
only subject she wished to think of.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer being an active person, erratic in her movements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and fond of talking, had many spare hours which
could not be spent with Mrs. Lambert, who got tired of the
girl, the moment her stock of news was exhausted, and
pined for solitude, being sick at heart, and weary of everything.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there was no other lady in the house, and, as Miss
Spicer must fraternize with some one, it naturally fell out
that she became intimate, and even confidential, with Ellen
Post.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little before Boyce brought his basket of groceries into
the kitchen, Miss Spicer and Ellen were together in the
young lady’s room, talking over the merits of a changeable
silk, which Miss Spicer was in suspense about, not being
quite certain of its effect upon her complexion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post stood in the centre of the room, her head
crowned with its little French cap, knowingly canted on one
side, as she held up the breadths of shimmering silk, which
changed and glistened like a pigeon’s neck with each movement
of her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, for Mrs. Lambert, I should say at once, take it,”
she said, with the solemn air of a priestess at the altar;
“but, for you, Miss Spicer, it is different. As a general
thing, solid colors, and delicate at that, is what I could
wish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think so, Ellen? Well, I am not sure. The silk
is exquisitely lovely in itself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, but haven’t you observed, Miss Spicer, that the
most charming tints in silk are not always the most telling,
when you get them on! There is the dress you wore the
other night. Now, to my mind, that dress was a failure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That dress a failure? Why, Ellen Post, it cost ten
dollars a yard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shouldn’t wonder; but still, it didn’t come up to my
expectations. When the madam came out, she killed it
dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Nothing, I believe, came up to any one’s expectations
that night. I never spent such an evening. Every one I
knew was out of sorts,” said the young lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure the madam was,” answered Ellen. “Never
saw her so wild and white in my life. What could have
happened? You ought to know, Miss Spicer—you, as one
might say, a part of the family.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I’m not, Ellen Post, and it’s likely I never shall
be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Miss Spicer, I thought it was settled. I am sure
the madam treats you as if you were her own daughter, and
Mr. Ivon——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there, don’t mention him! It’s only an aggravation.
One day sweet as honey-dew, the next after some
one else, flirting, like a humming-bird, right before my face,
and daring to tell me that another girl—one of those forward,
low creatures that sell goods—has rejected him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post dropped the silk which she had been holding,
and all its shining folds fell in a heap on the carpet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Spicer, you don’t mean to say that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I do mean to say just that, and could say more.
Only think, Ellen Post, of taking that girl’s leavings, a
creature with hair like ink, and eyes hid away under her
lashes like a brook sleeping under rushes. Then the impudence
of her air, walking like an empress, and she a shawl-fitter,
a—a—Oh, I would give five thousand dollars this
very hour to see her so disgraced, that he would be ashamed
to own that he had ever spoken to her. I hate her very
name!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is her name?” inquired Ellen Post.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Laurence. Eva Laurence. Such a name for a shop-girl!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva Laurence. I have heard that before. The madam
kept saying it over in her sleep the night she came home
from Mrs. Carter’s party. She does not like the girl more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>than you do, I am certain, though I never heard her speak
the name except in sleep; then it left her lips white as if
henbane had touched them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should not wonder,” exclaimed Miss Spicer, struck by
a sudden idea. “Didn’t you tell me that Mr. Ross, the
great artist, called here once or twice?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Once; I remember only once; but she received him in
her private room—a thing I do not remember of any other
man—and told me to say that she was not at home to a
human being. He stayed ever so long—three hours, I
should think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is strange,” said the young lady. “She must
have known him before.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br> <span class='large'>FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Spicer, if you’ll promise never to mention it, I’ll
tell you something,” said the maid, after a little consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I promise!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That man, Mr. Ross, I mean, once forced himself into
our garden, trampled down the beds, and insisted on finding
madam in one of the green-houses, where he did find her,
and there they talked together in a strange way. I did not
hear what they said, being in another part of the garden,
and old Storms there, so that I could not get closer; but his
voice was loud and clear, and hers—— Well, I can’t tell
you what hers was like, only there was something that went
to my heart in it—tears buried out of sight since she was a
girl. I should say——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Ellen, you have surprised me. Who would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>thought it of her—so proud, so grandly self-possessed? I
never dreamed that she could give way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give way! Why, that man left her on the conservatory
floor in a dead swoon,” said Ellen Post, bringing her
story to a climax with thrilling dexterity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer sunk down on the carpet, by the billowy
waves of silk that Ellen had dropped there, holding up her
hands in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Lambert in a swoon, a down right fainting fit! I
can’t believe it. Indeed, indeed, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may, for I helped to bring her out, and a dreadful
time we had of it. All that night long she lay like a dead
woman, and never spoke a word, except one, and that was a
name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What name, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman. I never heard it before, and I don’t know
who it belongs to in the least,” answered the lady’s maid.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman; that is <i>his</i> name—Herman Ross.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, one thing is sure!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is that, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She loves that man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellen Post, you take away my breath!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She loves that man. It was him she was dressing for
that night, when nothing could please her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The night of Mrs. Carter’s party; do you mean that,
Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course I mean that. Never saw her so hard to
please. I took off her diamonds twice, and had to put
them on again at last. Never saw anything like it. In
any other person I should have known the signs; but who
would suspect her of wanting to please any one in particular?
But it’s all clear now. We’ve settled on the right
man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Ellen, he’s going to marry this Laurence girl
himself!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“What! The man <i>she</i> loves?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As true as I sit here—he is engaged to her! It all
came out at the party. Mrs. Carter told it. This Ross is
her brother, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was what made her so white and wild. I understand
it all now. That is why she kept repeating the girl’s
name in her sleep, which was more like a fit than natural
slumber. She has not been herself since.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, you are right there; she seems like one stupefied
by a blow—and Ivon is not much better. He was wild as
a hawk that night. Only think of it—mother and son;
but it serves him right. I have no compassion for him, and
all but engaged to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if she marries this Ross, all will be at an end with
Mr. Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, it won’t. He thinks her the loveliest, the most
beautiful and accomplished creature in the world. Being
married won’t hurt her with him. He will never think
any one fit to untie her shoes. I want him to despise her—hate
her. I want to break up this match, which is killing
your poor mistress.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. What is the good of being rich when
the thing you want most can’t be got for money. Oh, if
I had that girl under my feet how I would stamp her
down!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post seated herself by the window, and fell into
thought. She was a sharp, even-tempered schemer, who saw
a chance of killing several birds with one stone, if it only
could be brought about. Her ideas were crude as yet, but
she saw a gleam of daylight through them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five thousand dollars! Did you say that, Miss
Spicer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said five thousand dollars. I don’t know what I said,
but I’d give even that. But what is the good?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“And you mean it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mean it? No, I don’t mean it, for the thing isn’t possible.
If it were I wouldn’t hesitate a moment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What you want is to disgrace the girl, so that neither
of these men would think of marrying her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is what I am pining for, and what will make your
lady a well and happy woman. It is for her sake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind! I see!” said Ellen, interrupting the
young lady without ceremony. “Now there are various
kinds of disgrace; some think poverty enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that won’t do here; she is poor as a church mouse
already, and they do not care a straw for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I understand. We must plunge deeper than that.
When it is accomplished, I may be sure of the five thousand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I might promise safely, and call it fifty thousand; but,
if it is possible for you to place this girl in a position which
will drive all honorable men from her, I will gladly give you
the sum I at first spoke of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She must know nothing of this. She would condemn us,
and reject our help, though it is mostly for her good,” said
the young lady, with emphasis. “This must rest between
you and myself. If another soul is informed, I for one will
throw up the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no need of that,” said Ellen, half buried in
thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Furthermore, I must have nothing to do with this, only
so far as the money is concerned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is understood. In fact, I see nothing that you
could be of use in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor do I see how any one can act as yet; but all the
same, Miss Spicer, I shall earn your money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well; I don’t ask how. I only wish for a thing,
and when it comes to pass, give so much money.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Five thousand,” said the maid.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five thousand,” answered the young lady, and the bargain
was closed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br> <span class='large'>MR. MAHONE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ellen Post went down to the kitchen just after Boyce
entered it with his basket of groceries, and there she found
Robert conversing in a low, eager voice with the grocer’s
clerk. As the two stood together, the girl remarked the
wonderful likeness that existed between them, in form and
color. Both were strong, and, if not tall, well built and
active. Boyce was talking earnestly, and glanced around
now and then to make sure that no one was listening.
There was a look of triumph in his face, that Robert seemed
to share, for he smiled broadly, while he listened, and
laying his hand on the clerk’s shoulder, seemed to commend
him for something he had done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post was impatient, and watched all this with irritation.
She wished to speak with Robert, and was angry that
he did not come forward the moment she entered the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone,” exclaimed the irate maid. “Mr. Mahone,
I am waiting to speak with you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mahone,” repeated Boyce, with a sly wink at the footman.
“She might spell that with five letters, and begin
them with a B.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce spoke in the lowest possible voice, but Robert
checked him severely, almost whispering.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush, you young rascal. Don’t you know that women
have sharp ears. Can I never learn you to be prudent.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“About the time I learn you to be fair,” answered Boyce,
a little savagely. “But, remember, this time you’ve got
to toe the mark. I don’t mean to do all the work, and
feed on the crumbs. So put that in your pipe, and smoke
it, Bob.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Miss Post, the minute I have settled up with this
fellow. He’s no more idea of figures than a donkey. Only
I notice he always makes the mistake on his side. As I
recommended him here, you understand, it’s my place to see
that everything is on the square.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post gave her French cap a toss that set all its ribbons
in quick motion, and would have left the room in high
dudgeon, but for the business that she had in hand. As it
was, she marched up to the young men, and broke up their
conference at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You stay here. We may have something to say to
you,” she said, addressing Boyce, as if she had been that
female tyrant, Elizabeth, and he a servant in her path.
“Mr. Mahone will tell you if you are wanted. So wait.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce laughed broadly, and took a seat in the kitchen,
while Ellen Post and Robert went to the servants’ parlor,
and shut themselves in, the maid observing that the cook
was always prying about, and, this thing being serious, they
must have no listeners. With this caution, she seated herself
on the hair-cloth sofa, and invited him, with her eyes,
to take the vacant place by her side.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert, nothing loth, took the seat, and his arm crept
along the back, until it almost embraced the long, thin
waist of the lady’s maid, who looked around sharply to
make sure that it was not indecorously near.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My angel! My—my——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind, Robert; this is business. I despise mixing
up things.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Business is pleasure, where you are concerned, Miss
Post.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is just what I hope it will lead to in the end, for
it’s a great thing, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed! Well, that don’t astonish me! You was born
to great things, Miss Post. No mistake about that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Which I am ready to share,” answered Ellen, “for it
will take more than one to earn five thousand dollars!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five thousand dollars! Why, Ellen, you take away my
breath.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It took away mine, at first; but now I am ready for
work. Are you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Am I ready to make five thousand dollars! Try me,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Robert, you know a boy by the name of Laurence. He
comes here with groceries now and then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I know all about him. He’s in the same store
with Boyce.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s got a sister?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. I’ve seen her. A stunning girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That girl has set her foot on Miss Spicer!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! There must be some mistake about that; they
don’t travel the same road.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No mistake at all. I know what I’m saying. More
than that, she has offended the madam, who is bitter against
her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t say so!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is handsome.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stupendously so. Her face fairly took me off my feet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Mahone dropped his arm, and almost leaped to his
feet; a whole volley of small shot rolled off in that one
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg ten thousand pardons, Miss Post. I was speaking
of the opinion others might have. As for me, I have eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>only for one woman, this side of sunrise, and that woman is
Ellen Post.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone, sit down. It is hard when the heart is
wounded to stick to business; but stick we must.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Ellen, I don’t object. You were speaking of Miss
Laurence. I know all about her!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how?” demanded Ellen, forgetting business again,
in a sharp fit of jealousy. “Mr. Mahone, do you visit that
creature?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me? me? Do you think I haven’t better taste than
Mr. Ivon? He visits her; but, as for me, I’d rather be
excused, not being necessitated to go away from home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is not business,” exclaimed Ellen, growing practical,
as her jealousy was appeased. “The long and the short
of it is, this girl has been forcing herself into the company
of her betters, which neither the madam or Miss Spicer will
stand. Mr. Ivon has taken to her in a way quite ridiculous;
so has another person of quite as much importance.
The ladies don’t want her to cross their path again. We
must see that she don’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Laurence family, root and branch, must be brought
to disgrace. Being poor as Job’s cat isn’t enough, for some
rich people have taken them up. She must be so covered
with shame, that no one will have the courage to speak to
her in the street.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how is it to be done. We might get up a big
scandal; but people are getting shy of believing such
things, when they come from the basement; but for that, I
am capital at building castles out of card-houses. In our
line now, I could work wonders against any girl——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not any girl, Mr. Mahone,” broke in Ellen, with a hot
burst of pride. “There are persons that slander cannot
reach!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I meant any girl like that, if she belonged to our spear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Miss Ellen. Of course, there are women as high as the
stars. Having a sample before me, I can say that, and defy
contradiction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The girl is awful proud of her family; poor but honest,
you know,” said Ellen, once more mollified to the business
point.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honest! My eyes! that is good! Why, Boyce was
just telling me that the boy has been robbing like sixty—hand
in hand with a lot of burglars. It’s a secret; but the
detectives are on his track now.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER. L.<br> <span class='large'>A BARGAIN AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t say so! Oh, Mr. Mahone, this is news!
Why, just as like as not, she’s leagued in with him. That
whole family may be a nest of thieves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A nest of thieves—and she among them, I shouldn’t
wonder!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Prove it; fasten it upon them; have the thing made
public, and our work is done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Would</i> that be enough?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly. Could any girl creep out of a nest of
thieves, into such society as the madam and Miss Spicer
move in? I should think not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would it be enough to prove the boy guilty?” questioned
Robert, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No: she will want more than that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And even there we may fail. I have it—I have it!
Don’t put yourself to any more trouble. The whole thing
has come into my head at once. I only hope you are as sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>of the money, as I am of earning it. Five thousand you
said?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five thousand!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Money down?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Money down!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the division. We may as well start fair, you know,
this being business and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post looked down, and began to roll up her cap-string
with both hands; then she unrolled it, and smoothed
out the ribbon. Something was doubtless in her mind, that
she did not know how to put into speech. At last she
faltered out,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would there be any need of a division? I thought—I
thought, perhaps, that you might prefer the whole, which is
a fortune for two young persons just starting life in a liquor
store, say, or a first-class boarding-house, where a real lady
is wanted for the head of the table.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen looked up anxiously. What did that emphatic
“oh” mean. Had Mahone only thought of this for the
first time?</p>

<p class='c006'>The face she cast her timid eyes upon was changing
rapidly; first, a red flame darted up to the roots of his
ruddy hair, then the color melted away, and a slow pallor
stole over it, while a thoughtful and sinister light crept into
the golden-green eyes. Ellen grew fearfully uneasy. The
thousands she coveted would lose half their value, unless
Mahone himself was counted in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You say ‘oh,’ as if I had hinted at something disagreeable,
Mr. Mahone? If so, let us drop the subject. Other
people can be found.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mahone started, for the girl spoke in bitter earnest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Other people, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Post, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be so cold, so cruel! If I said ‘oh,’ it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>because a prospect of happiness broke upon me, that took
away my breath.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mahone seized the hand which was lifted to the
cap-string again, and repeated the naughty word oh, oh, oh,
half a dozen times between the kisses he lavished upon it;
but, strange to say, the obnoxious syllable seemed rather
pleasant to her than otherwise this time. Circumstances
alter cases, you know.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To think that I shall have a creature like this, and five
thousand dollars, all in a breath. I cannot believe it. If a
fortune-teller had foretold it, I should have set her down as
a rank impostor, and refused to pay her fee. But now, tell
me, my Ellen, <i>is</i> it real? Not the money. I don’t care
the snap of my finger for that! But is it possible that you
love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love you, Robert? Mr. Mahone, I mean!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, call me Robert; do call me Robert!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I will! You asked if I loved you? I who never
lifted admiring eyes to another man; had you no eyes to
read mine, no heart to hear how mine was beating like a—a
trip-hammer against my side? Did you never suspect?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never dared to hope; but now—now I am the happiest
man alive! You will not talk of other people after
this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a tone of anxiety in this last question quite as
sincere as the protestations he had made; but Ellen did
not observe it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall talk nor think of no one but you, Robert.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Some one knocked at the parlor-door, rather sturdily, and
broke up this pleasant scene, which might have lasted for
hours, but for that. Mahone started up, and opened the
door, where he found Boyce flushed with impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you was never coming out,” he said, rudely
enough. “I have got business to attend to, and can’t sit
waiting here. If you’ve got any more to say, say it now.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“I’ll walk with you, Boyce,” answered Robert, “if Miss
Post will excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Post bowed with condescension, and the two young
men went into the street together.</p>

<p class='c006'>That night a woman who lived in a tall tenement house
not very far from Smith’s grocery, was surprised by the
entrance of two men, with whom she was doubtless on terms
of great domestic intimacy, for she came out of her bedroom
half dressed, and a little cross, for she had been working
hard all day, and dropped to sleep while hushing the
child upon the bed she had found no time to make. Something
that the men proposed made her angry, for she protested,
and had fierce words with the tallest of her visitors,
who rudely ordered her to be silent, and go back to her
child. With some grumbling she obeyed him.</p>

<p class='c006'>After that, these men came up and down the numerous
flights of stairs, again and again, carrying burdens on their
shoulders. Then a wagon drove off, and, for an hour or
two, the same men were moving like shadows around the
house where the Laurence family lay sleeping.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LI.<br> <span class='large'>A BOY IN PRISON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The most mournful thing that I have ever witnessed was
a child in prison. Once I saw a hardened little sinner of
twelve years, laughing at his mother through the gratings
of a cell-door. This child was evidently proud of the
adroit theft that had brought him to that disgraceful pass,
and put on airs that an old criminal would have been
ashamed of, while the poor mother looked on speechless
with wonder and distress.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>In the same prison, and in a cell like that, a boy younger
than twelve, knelt the week after Mrs. Carter’s party—knelt
and prayed by the meagre prison-bed, which shook under
the fearful power of his weeping. Once he lifted up his
face, and looked wildly around his dungeon. Then his face
fell, and a shudder passed over him. A grave, walled in
with stone, could not have been so terrible. Eternal disgrace
seemed to have closed him in forever. Alas! alas! what
had he done to deserve such hard treatment! What would
become of his mother, whom he had fondly believed himself
protecting? The two sisters, so lovely and good, who
had really looked up to him, and loved him dearly—would
they ever speak his name again without blushes!</p>

<p class='c006'>How fearfully lonesome it was. The strange, close
atmosphere oppressed him like the breath of a pestilence.
The cold whiteness of the walls chilled him. Over and over
he repeated the Lord’s Prayer—the most holy words that
ever came from a child’s lips; but they seemed insufficient
to his anguish, and he cried out, “Oh, Father! Oh, my
God! keep this from them! Let me drop down dead here,
and I will not say a word; only do not let them know. It
would kill them! It would kill them!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the poor boy would rest a little time in deadly quiet,
as if he expected God to answer him then and there; but
instead of the still, small voice that he listened for, came
the clang of the cell-door, and a fierce cry of distress from
some prisoner just brought in. This semi-lunatic from
drink, pleaded for brandy just as earnestly as he prayed for
help, but in language which made him shudder, as if the
torment of some great crime were already upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The night closed in upon him, filling the prison with
heavy gloom, inexpressibly mournful. The grating of that
iron-door was closed: slowly the gray shadows of sunset fell
through the long, narrow slit of stone, so cut in the wall
that God’s beautiful sunshine could never creep through,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>and an awful darkness fell upon him. The clang of each
door, as it swung into place along those long iron galleries,
had gone through and through him like a dull sword. The
heavy step of the keeper, walking from cell to cell, seemed
to fall on his heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy did not sleep that night, but shrunk away from
his bed shuddering. Its heavy, gray blankets seemed laden
with disease and sorrow left by some one who had gone
before. The dull atmosphere of the prison settled down
upon him with sickening density. Into the farthest corner
of his whitewashed cell he shrunk, and cowering there, like
some poor wounded fawn in its covert, listened to all the
noises of the night with ears rendered keen by terror. The
smothered moans of the prisoners, the scuttle of rats about
the water-pipes, the tramp of the keeper on the stone pavement,
far below, all had a weird effect upon him, which
amounted almost to madness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Is it strange that the boy did not sleep, and that he
crouched low in that dark corner all night long? The dull
gray of the morning found him there pale, still, and wildly
expectant, as if the next thing that could reach him must
be death itself. Then came the clang of opening doors,
the harsh sound of feet moving to and fro on the stone
pavement, a confusion of voices in command, complaint,
piteous expostulation, and coarse oaths; for bad men might
be chained by the ankle, but nothing could manacle the vile
speech to which they had become so used that it was second
nature to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this boy had been bred among women, gentle, good
women who feared, or rather loved God, and were kind to
each other. Even his mother, though silent, and sometimes
a little unsympathetic, was rigid in her ideas of religion, and
sanctioned nothing coarse or wicked, either in speech or
thought. So the boy had learned all that a delicate girl
should have known; and this, added to his natural manliness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>had made him far more refined and gentle than lads
of his age usually are. He was not the less spirited and
ambitious because of the refinement which sprang out of
his home life. Real energy is, in fact, all the more effective
when a clear conscience and cultivated mind directs it, both
in child and man.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what could energy avail the lad in that dreary place?
He had nothing to struggle against; a vague idea that he
was suspected of crime, and brought there to suffer some terrible
punishment, preyed upon him, but what the charge
was, or how to help himself, was beyond his power of conjecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some bread, and a teacupful of dark liquid the keeper
spoke of as coffee, was brought to the cell where he sat trembling
and fearfully expectant. The poor boy turned his
face away from this food with sick loathing. It seemed as if
he could never eat or drink again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The keeper, who was at heart a kind man, took compassion
on the gentle helplessness of this poor child, and strove
to comfort him with hopes of a speedy relief; but James only
shook his head, and great tears rose and trembled in his eyes.
He could have stood abuse bravely, but kindness melted his
young heart, and tears dropped like rain from his downcast
eyes while that sympathetic voice filled the dungeon. As
he sat thus the shadow of another official fell across the
threshold of his cell, and a loud and indifferent voice called
out,</p>

<p class='c006'>“James Laurence!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy started up and followed this man into the prison
yard. He had scarcely stepped upon the stone-flags, when
two officers passed him, leading a woman toward the female
prison. The boy saw her face, and flinging out his arms
cried out,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother! mother! oh, mother!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LII.<br> <span class='large'>THE SECOND ARREST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Smith had acted with a stern, secret energy. Without
consulting his wife, or any one but an iron-hearted detective,
he had quietly arrested little James Laurence, and lodged
him in the Tombs. Early the next morning, while Mrs.
Laurence was busy cooking her meagre breakfast, a strange
man stepped into the kitchen, boldly, as if it had been his
own home, and told her to get her things, and not attempt
to raise a muss about it, because it was of no use; her son
was caught, and nicely caged. She was known to be his
accomplice—in fact, the person who had no doubt set him
on. At any rate he had a warrant against her, as a
receiver, and she had better obey it just then and there.
The stolen goods had been found in her out-house, and he
was after the money sharp; must search the house for that,
but not till she was disposed of according to law. Was she
ready?</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence heard all this in stern astonishment. She
had been cutting bread, and stood with the knife in one
hand, grasping the loaf in the other, motionless as stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me? Me, and my son James? Are you speaking of
us?” she said at last. “What have you done with him?
What do you want of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as if you didn’t know. Well, if you will have it,
I want you to step out before a justice, and answer for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Answer for what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For stealing! Robbery! I think they’d call this
burglary, only the boy was in the house, and so, of course,
could only break out, if breaking was to be done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stealing! Robbery!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>These words fell from the woman’s lips like lead dropping
on marble. A stupor of astonishment seemed turning her
to stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My boy! James, my boy! You said something
strange about him; horribly strange, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said that we had him safe in the Tombs, where you
will be mighty quick, or I’m mistaken. But, come along;
it’s the best way. The gentleman wanted me to get through
without making a fuss in the neighborhood. So get your
things, and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is this? Mother, who is this man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence instantly came out of the icy trance that
had settled on her faculties, and answered sharply,</p>

<p class='c006'>“A person on business, Eva. I believe I am going out;
tell your sister so, and bring my bonnet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva detected nothing in the cold, steady voice of her
mother to occasion alarm, and went into the next room for
the bonnet and shawl, which she usually wore to market.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence took these things from her hand, and put
them on. There was no tremor of the fingers when she
tied her bonnet-strings; no heave or flutter of the bosom,
when the faded shawl was folded over it. This poor woman
had been so used to bearing her own burdens in silence,
that even this fearful shock was endured with speechless
heroism.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Girls,” she said, looking in at the parlor-door, and
speaking rather more cheerfully than usual, “don’t wait for
me, but eat your breakfast; Eva must not be late.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth looked up, and answered, smiling, in her meek,
sweet way, “that she would rather wait. Eva, of course,
must go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no answer to this, and a minute after Ruth
saw her mother go through the gate, followed by that strange
man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder if it’s anything about the mortgage?” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>thought, anxiously. “Only a few months more, and I should
have the money. No, Eva, dear,” she said, in answer to
something her sister had suggested. “I have no appetite
just now, and will wait for mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wait for mother! Poor girl!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE WOMAN IN THE LAUNDRY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>That morning, a woman, rather young but meanly clad,
and appearing miserably over-worked, came into Mrs. Lambert’s
kitchen. She was conducted to the laundry by the
cook, whose department had fallen so woefully behind hand
in the way of table-linen, that she considered a little outside
help necessary. The woman who was usually called
upon, when such occasions arose, happened to be ill, and
had sent this haggard young person, who lived in the same
tenement house, as a substitute. The laundry in which her
work lay was a little dark, and for that reason the door leading
into the kitchen was left partly open.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the morning a young man came in, carrying a
basket of groceries, and, while the cook was heaping the
different articles on a table, the two fell into conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the washerwoman’s eyes fell on this young man,
she stopped work, and the napkin she was rubbing rolled
down the wash-board into the suds, while she held on to a
side of the tub with each hand, looking keenly through the
door, herself quite unseen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had to do it myself this morning,” said the youth,
addressing the cook, “because our boy’s been and got took
up for helping to rob the concern.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not that pretty, dark-eyed little fellow that comes here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>generally of late,” said the cook, with something like regret
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, just him; and no mistake about that. He was
took to the Tombs last night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t say so! What did he take?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Money, and lots on lots of groceries—tea worth its
weight in gold; lots of things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what could he do with them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it’s all out now, and I don’t mind your knowing
about it. The boy’s mother is a sly old party, poor as a
wharf-rat, and, oh my, how crafty! She sot the boy on,
and hid the things for him in the wood-house. The detective
found them there. Now, tell me, do you want any
better proof than that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then they found the things on the premises?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just what they did, and this morning the old
woman was walked off by a policeman. I saw her go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m awful sorry for the boy,” said the good-natured
cook; “he seemed such a nice little shaver. Them
eyes didn’t look dishonest; but there is no knowing who to
trust these times.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly! Shouldn’t wonder if some one was to suspect
me, one of these days. The more innercent a feller looks,
the more suspicious, say I. But, tell me, is Mr. Mahone
about? I’d just like to speak a word with him, if you’ll be
kind enough to look him up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The cook laid a paper parcel on the table, and good-naturedly
went in search of Mr. Mahone, observing,</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s more than likely in the servants’ parlor, with Ellen
Post. Now you’ve told me some news that’ll give me a fit
of mournfulness all day long, so I’ll just rertalerate, and tell
you something worth while. Mr. Mahone and Ellen Post
are engaged. They’re going to be married right out of
hand. She’s going to open a first-class boarding-house, and
he——Well, I suppose he’ll do like the rest of ’em, and
keep up the marketing.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>A clothes-horse, full of snow-white linen, stood near the
door where these two persons were talking. The woman at
the wash-tub, who had become strangely interested, as the
conversation went on, stole softly behind this screen, and
stood close to the wall, not three feet from the cook and her
companion. She heard all that they were saying, and the
last sentence brought a flash of fire to her dark eyes. Why
she could not herself have told, for she knew of no person
named Mahone, and she had never heard of Ellen Post in
her life. Still the fire was in her eyes, and a sharp throb
of nameless suspicion in her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a moment the young man Boyce was silent, then a
low shrill whistle broke from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, that’s his little game, is it! Well, all right. Just
say that I’m here and a waiting to speak with him. I’ll
stay here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The cook having disposed of her groceries, gave the
empty basket to Boyce, and went into the servants’ parlor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Directly the footman came out, looking flushed and
anxious.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it you, Boyce?” he said, pausing close to the laundry-door,
and peering in to be sure the room was empty.
“Just step inside here, and be quick; you and I must not
be seen together much just now. Well, what is it?
Speak low!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The old woman, Mrs. Laurence, was arrested this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right! But how do you know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I stood in the store, and saw the man go that way; you
know the house is in full sight. By just stepping under
the awning I can see the vines on the porch, and that crowd
of flowers in front.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does Mrs. Smith know yet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. She’s just found it out, and pitched into her
husband awful. He’s satisfied, and won’t give way an inch.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>But isn’t she on the rampage! The worst of it is, I’ve got
to go before the justice, and I tell you it’s unpleasant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; but you are in for it, and must go through. Anything
else?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; something that the cook told me. Tell me, old
fellow, have you put your foot in it to the extent of saddling
yourself with another sweetheart. She talks of your being
engaged, of a wedding, and so forth. How much of this is
true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The footman drew Boyce farther into the room, and shut
the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I say Boyce, if I was to marry a woman, with more than
five hundred dollars laid up from wages, and five thousand a
pretty sure thing, would you stand by me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Through thick and thin; so long as we shared!”
answered Boyce, holding out his hand, and working his long
fingers like the claws of a bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, I should be liberal. Brothers are brothers,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and don’t they grind one another down? Oh, no,
never! It isn’t in the natur of one to do nothing, and take
all he can grip at. He never lets any one take risks of the
law for him. Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you will run no risk when I marry Ellen Post.
The law comes on me there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly. But I come between you and the law, having
seen you married to that other woman, and knowing just
where she’s to be found any minute!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well, you will not be unreasonable?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no! But won’t she cut up rusty?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How is she to find out? What does Mary Boyce know
about Robert Mahone? Why, she don’t know who I am
living with. In fact, thinks I’m tending bar in some place
where women never come; generally out of business though,
or I shouldn’t get a share of her earnings.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“And you mean to do it, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. I’ve made up my mind. Such a pile of money
don’t tumble in upon a fellow without some risk; so I’ll
stand the racket, especially as Ellen Post is a splendid
cretur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Handsomer than Mary?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No comparison; but you’ve seen her. She was out here
the other day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! That woman with the cap and ribbons? You
don’t say so; golly! here she comes, and I’m off. Don’t
want to be introduced to my new sister-in-law just yet.
She might put on airs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With these words Boyce stepped into the kitchen, took
up his basket, and left the house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIV.<br> <span class='large'>PREPARING FOR THE WEDDING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Mahone! Mr. Mahone! Is there any news?”
said Ellen Post, advancing toward the laundry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush! Step in here; the cook is always prowling in
and out of that room. That’s right. Shut the door. You
were asking about news. Yes, indeed, that boy was arrested
yesterday. This morning an officer is after the old woman—two
of the Laurence family are in for it. As for that
girl, Eva, I’m afraid we can’t fasten on her just yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, we can wait for her. Mrs. Lambert’s agent was
here this morning about foreclosing a mortgage on the
house. They haven’t kept up the interest. I don’t think
she’d order them turned out, much as she hates them. So
I told him she was sick; but I’d take up his message,
which was to ask for directions. She was asleep on the sofa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>so I told him that she was not well enough to talk about
business, but wanted this troublesome mortgage closed up at
once, without bothering her again about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was a ten strike,” said the admiring Robert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, when they get back from prison, their shanty will be
gone, and we shall have rooted them out, trunk and branch.
I’m sure that must satisfy Miss Spicer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. If she don’t pay the five thousand down after
that, she’s no lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Which she is,” answered Ellen, with emphasis. “Why,
the very last night, she, knowing what was between us, Mr.
Mahone, gave me a white-silk dress, only twice worn, with
real lace on the sleeves and bosom, and a wreath of white
flowers, which she says are just as fashionable for brides as
orange-blossoms, which she hasn’t had any use for as yet—more’s
the shame to Mr. Ivon, who behaves as no gentleman
has a right to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, no one can say that we haven’t done our share.
When will she pay over, my dear?” questioned Mahone,
drawing Ellen tenderly toward him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as soon as we are married. I asked her, and she
said that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She did? Well, well! When will that be? With
the wedding dress all ready, we might have it in the basement-parlor,
within a week.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mr. Mahone, think of it? I couldn’t. The cake—the
invitations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hang the cake! and as for inform——I beg pardon,
invitations; the genteel thing is a strictly private wedding.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A private wedding, and that dress? <i>Such</i> a silk! You
could almost stand it alone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes, I know. But who does a bride dress for but
her admiring husband? I shall worship you in that bridal
robe and them flowers; but don’t ask me to share the beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>sight with any other man. I couldn’t stand it, being
that jealous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mr. Mahone, I had so set my heart upon it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not as I have set my heart on you, Ellen. Just a carriage,
with you and your adorer in it, the white-silk dress a
rustling around your lovely person, trimmed with flowers
white. Well, yes, white, as bridal flowers ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! Without bridemaids?—without witnesses?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My love, I have thought of that. There is my friend
Boyce, a genteel fellow, in the grocery line, who has a sweetheart
of his own, a Miss Gorman, splendid old Irish name;
not to be compared with yours of course, but still respectable
on a certificate, very.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Mr. Mahone, you seem to have settled everything,”
cried Ellen, half angry, half elated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Always under your wishes, being only your shadow
and nothing more, Miss Ellen, and having, in fact, no will
of my own, nor wanting any.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So private! So soon! I really don’t know what to say,
Mr. Mahone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me say it for you, dearest of women; let me take
this modest hesitation for yes. May I—may I?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone, you may.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A moment after this consent was given, the betrothed
pair stole from the laundry, Mahone first and Miss Post
after. She passed the cook with a lofty fling of the head,
and apologized with mock humility for her presence in a
place so far out of her usual element as a kitchen, at which
the cook said “Scat,” which certainly did seem a little out
of place, as no cat, black or white, was disturbing the tranquillity
of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not ten minutes after this the washerwoman came out of
the laundry with her bonnet and shawl on, white as a ghost,
but with undaunted fire in her eyes. In fact the poor
drudge looked full of life, and almost handsome; a very different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>woman from the jaded and hopeless creature who had
crept into the house with such humility only a few hours
before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will please excuse me, I am not well enough for
hard work to-day; for the whole world I couldn’t get out
another piece.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman said this in a quick, eager way, as if she had
quite determined on going, whether her apology was accepted
or not.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cook would have argued with her, but the whole
matter was cut short by the woman walking abruptly out
of the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meantime Ellen Post knocked at the door of Miss
Spicer’s room. That young lady turned the latch with her
own hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was that Mr. Lambert that just came in? I thought
it was his step on the stairs?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, Miss,” answered Ellen, confidentially. “It’s only
me; but I’ve got good news. The old woman and her boy
are both in the hands of a policeman. Would it be convenient
to let me have that amount?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When they are convicted!” answered Miss Spicer, closing
the door abruptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post stood for a moment in blank amazement, then
she gave her head a toss and, speaking to herself, said
sharply,</p>

<p class='c006'>“We shall see! We shall see!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LV.<br> <span class='large'>EVA’S TEMPTATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva Laurence had no appetite for breakfast, and lingered
about home long after she should have been at her
duties at the store. There was something so unusual in
her mother’s going out very early in the morning with a
strange man, that both the girls were greatly disturbed,
though each strove to hide her anxiety from the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once Eva put on her bonnet, and went as far as the gate,
on her way down town; but, after lingering there a minute,
she came back again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot go, Ruthy,” she said, with keen anxiety in
her voice and manner. “Where has she gone? It is now
two hours! What can have become of her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth could hardly answer. Her eyes were full of
trouble; her delicate form trembled all over. She clutched
nervously at the cushions, but still persisted in saying,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, she will be home again before long. Nothing can
have happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will, at any rate, stay here till she comes,” said Eva,
taking off the outer garments she had put on. “I wonder
where James is? Mrs. Smith ought not to keep him all
night so often. She might reflect how lonesome we are
without him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is strange; he is always sure to run in during the
morning,” said Ruth, shaking like a flower in the wind,
with weird terror of some unknown evil. “What is
that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva ran to the window—the gate had opened. It might
be her mother. No, it was Mr. Ross coming leisurely up
the walk. He saw Eva, and smiled. She could not answer
this pleasant greeting, but hurried to the door, anxious and
breathless.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Oh, Mr. Ross, do you bring us any news? We are so
anxious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“About what, my child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why mother has been out since early this morning.
A man came here before breakfast, and she went with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what do you fear? It is not noon yet. How
frightened you look! There, there, your mother is sure to
come back safely. She is not a woman to run into
danger.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The cool, good sense of their visitor tranquilized the girls,
and they made strong efforts to be cheerful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As for my part,” said Ross, sitting down near Ruth,
“I am rather glad she is away. The matter I came to talk
about does not require her presence just yet. Eva, I have
come from my sister, who renews the offer half made to you
some nights ago. We desire, very much, that you should
come to us, and be a part of our household. Carter is
willing, his wife desires it, and I ask no greater blessing
than to look upon you as my own child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva started up, clasping her hands with a thrill of unthinking
joy; but they fell apart hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, sir! Oh, my friend! I cannot; it is impossible!
To leave my family now, when my work is of so much use,
would be cruel beyond anything. Look at poor Ruthy.
The first thought of it has set her trembling!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva’s eyes were full of tears. The idea of this offer had
haunted her with temptations, which she resisted, now that
trouble was in the house with double force.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ross smiled. He did not like the girl less for this
generous clinging to her home duties.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be better a thousand times,” cried Eva, with
passionate warmth, “that you took Ruthy; though what
on earth we should do without her, I cannot tell. She,
with her genius and goodness, might be a blessing in any
house, while I am only useful here.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“My dear child, how quick you are to decide. We do
not propose to take anything from your family; on the contrary,
in partially leaving it, every one will be benefited.
My sister intends to settle upon Mrs. Laurence five times
the amount you can earn. I propose to put that fine little
fellow, your brother, into school, and after that, through
college. As for Miss Ruth here, if she will remain my
pupil a few months longer, there will be no need of your
toil. Her pencil will do far more than your labor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva looked at her sister in wonder. There she lay,
blushing like a wild rose, trembling like its leaves, and
smiling in spite of the fears that had so oppressed her—a
creature so delicate and frail, that helplessness seemed her
portion forever. Could it be possible, that pure genius in a
creature like that, might accomplish more than all her
strength of life and power of action? Was genius so far
above everything else in this world? These thoughts
broke forth in a burst of tender enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Ruthy! Ruthy! Is it so? Are you to be the
bread-winner, and I the drone? I cannot believe it! I
cannot believe it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor I,” said Ruthy. “It seems like a miracle; but, oh,
I will work <i>so</i> hard! Ah, Mr. Ross, you opened a new life
to me, when you pronounced my poor sketches worthy of
notice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The life of genius is always new, for its very essence is
creation,” answered Ross, with subdued enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, to chain genius down to the earning of money,
seems so unsuited to its greatness,” said Eva.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unsuited to its greatness!” exclaimed Ross. “Is it a
degradation to be useful, to give bread for thought—for
mental power to transmute itself into material blessings?
Is the man or woman of genius higher or prouder than the
God who made him? Is the wheat, which bends in green
and ripening waves to the wind, and grows golden under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the sunshine, less beautiful because hungry millions feed on
it? Are the lilies of the field more splendid than the fruit
with which our orchards are laden? Why, Eva, every
grand or lovely thing that God has created has its uses for
mankind. While men starve and suffer, no gift that comes
from Him can remain idle without sin. The great reward
of genius is its power to confer blessings; first, by the effort
itself, giving new objects of thought or beauty to the world,
and again by the material rewards, which cannot be used
without adding to the comfort and happiness of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross spoke with an outburst of feeling, which Eva’s little
speech, natural to a romantic girl, need hardly have called
forth. She blushed crimson, feeling his ardent words as a
rebuke, while Ruth seemed to kindle up with living fire.
Her eyes flashed like stars, and a handful of carnations
seemed to have been dashed against her cheek, leaving a
delicate stain there. She rose to her elbow, radiant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva!” she said. “If you knew how happy it has
made me to win a little money, when you all need it so
much, you would never talk as if the earning it could be
considered unsuitable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right,” answered Eva, almost crying. “It was
a thoughtless speech.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because you really had never considered the subject,”
answered Ross, heartily ashamed of his own enthusiasm.
“But all this brings us no nearer to the question in hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Both the sisters grew silent, and the color faded slowly
from their faces. They looked at each other with yearning
fondness, and, as if influenced by one feeling, the eyes of
both filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It can hardly be called a separation,” said Ross, touched
with lively sympathy. “There need not be a day in which
you cannot see each other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She must go,” faltered Ruth, stretching forth her arms.
“To keep her with us would be cruel.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Eva sunk upon her knees by the couch, and buried her
face in Ruthy’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No! no!” she said. “We cannot part; not while they
have need of me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, remember mother, how much more you would be
doing for her and James, who felt it so hard to give up
school,” pleaded Ruth. “This is a poor place for you, my
sister.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But is it better for you and mother?” questioned Eva,
almost indignantly, for the temptation to go was strong
within her, and she hated herself for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we will soon make this home pleasanter for them
than it has ever been,” said Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is that? Mother?” cried Ruth, who heard a
woman’s step in the porch. “She will think with us, I am
sure, Eva.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVI.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. SMITH BRINGS PAINFUL NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva did not reply to her sister’s question, for she had
hurried to the door, and found not her mother, as she eagerly
expected, but Mrs. Smith, with her bonnet awry, and her
shawl trailing to the ground. The good woman’s face was
flushed with crying, and a fresh rain of tears came to her
eyes the moment she saw Eva.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t! Don’t! Order me from the door! Don’t
wither me up into nothing, just with looking in my face!
It wasn’t my fault; I knew no more about it than my
Jerusha Maria, poor innocent darling, that never dreamed
what a cruel father she’s got. I’ll never live with Smith
again—never! To go and do such a thing, without telling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>me! I’m not a cannibal, nor a Hottentot to stand such
things!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith had burst forth in this torrent of words and
tears on the very doorstep. Eva entreated her to come in.
Being utterly ignorant of the particular grief that possessed
the good woman, she could do no more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re just one degree from a heavenly angel, Eva
Laurence,” continued the good woman, wiping her eyes on
the corner of her shawl, as she passed into the parlor.
“Smith won’t, but I’ve come to make atonement on my
bended knees. Tell me what to do for them, and I’ll do it,
if Jerusha Maria and I are left without a crust.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear Mrs. Smith, what do you mean? Who has
troubled you so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who? My own lawfully married husband. What?
Oh, mercy upon me! don’t you know yet? Where’s your
mother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She went out this morning,” said Eva, “and has not
returned yet. We are expecting her every minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Expecting her! Why, don’t you know? Expecting
her? Oh! oh! this is hard, that I should have to tell it,
and he my husband! Eva, both your mother and James
are in prison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In prison!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Three voices at once uttered this one sentence. Ruth
started up from her couch, white to the lips; Eva stood
rooted to the floor, her eyes widening, and lips just apart.
Even Mr. Ross started to his feet, and a swarthy color
swept over his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In prison! For what?” he demanded. “Who put
them there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Must I say it again? It was my own husband that
did it, backed up, and led blind by that copper-headed cretur,
Ja Boyce. I know as well as I live, that he’s at the
bottom of it, though Smith sticks to him through thick and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>thin. As for that boy, he’s innocent as twenty lambs,
every one of ’em with fleeces white as snow; but you can’t
make Smith believe it, he’s that blinded.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pray, Mrs. Smith, compose yourself, and tell us clearly
what all this means? On what charge are these two persons
in prison?” said Ross, who was the first to recover
his presence of mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Charges? Why, theft! burglary! receiving stolen
property! Our store was robbed on the night we went to
your sister’s party. And they are took up for doing it. I
didn’t know it till just now. Oh, they were mighty sly,
Kate Gorman and all, taking people up, and keeping me in
the dark; but I’ve left ’em. Smith will find out what he’s
done when I am gone, and his home is full of nothing but
loneliness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where have they been taken to, Mrs. Smith?” inquired
Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where? The Tombs, to be sure. No other place was
gloomy enough for them. Smith has gone down to appear.
Yes, and a pretty appearance he’ll put in for himself. Oh,
girls, it was not my fault!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor woman clasped her hands, and seemed about to
fall upon her knees before Eva, who flung both arms about
her neck, and tenderly wiped her eyes, though her hands
shook in doing it, and the dumb anguish in her face was
pitiful to see.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whatever it is, we shall never blame you, Mrs. Smith,”
gasped Ruth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith fell on her knees before the sick girl’s couch,
and burst into a fresh paroxysm of tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you <i>must</i> blame him. Who can help it? To keep
such things secret from the wife of his bosom, hard as a
rock, too, against that poor honest, crusty, dear old woman.
Oh, it’s too bad! too bad! But that he told me himself, I
never would have believed it; but there he is, gone down to
persecute like a heathen grind-stone.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Be tranquil, be patient, my dear young ladies. I will
go at once, and see what this means,” said Ross, taking
Eva’s hand, which scarcely trembled more than his own.
“They will need some friend. Have no fear; I shall know
how to help them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I will go with you,” cried Eva, turning to leave the
room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; not yet. It would only do harm. All that can
be done I will attend to. It is impossible that there should
be anything serious in this. Stay quietly at home till you
hear from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva hesitated. Her first generous impulse was to brave
everything for the two beings she loved so dearly. But
nobility of purpose is not always prudently carried out. It
requires more fortitude to stay at home and wait, than to
rush out and act. The girl was brave, but she was also
obedient, and when Ruth spoke, she turned from her purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stay, Eva,” said the gentle invalid. “You can do
nothing. Our good friend will help us. Stay till he
comes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva sat down, and burst into tears. Forbidden to act,
she could only weep and wait.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell him that I have left his house! That—that he is
a cruel, hard-hearted man! Tell him that there is no sort
of use in his ever coming home again—for—for—— Oh,
it is dreadful! Why can’t people die when they want to?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith would have added more no doubt, but half
these words were smothered on Ruth’s couch; and when
she looked up, Mr. Ross was passing through the garden-gate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, girls, what shall we do?” she exclaimed, “what
shall we do! Just say that I never ought to speak to
Smith again, and I won’t; no, not if he takes Jerusha
Maria out of my arms, and gives her—oh! oh!—to some
other woman.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“My dear friend,” murmured Ruth, “go home to your
child—all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I will go!” sobbed the good woman; “but it
shall be down there.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVII.<br> <span class='large'>IN HASTE FOR THE WEDDING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Miss Ellen Post was taking in the waist of Miss
Spicer’s white silk dress, and had altered the trimming till
it really seemed as good as new. Miss Spicer, herself, had
come down into the servants’ parlor to examine the effect,
and had brought from her own room a  quantity of tulle
scarcely the worse for wear, which had once covered a trained
over-dress, but was quite fresh enough for the wedding
veil; especially as the breadths were joined neatly by a
white wreath, which had been beautifully freshened up for
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some deeper anxiety than the wedding dress had evidently
brought the young heiress into the servants’ department,
for she pushed aside a mass of silk tulle and fragments
of lace from a couch which stood near the expectant
bride, and seemed to prepare herself for a conversation of
some length.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Post was very busy with the bridal veil, and threw
her whole energies so completely into the pleasant task, that
she had little attention to bestow even on the young lady
who had honored her by a visit, and from whom she expected
so much.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus Miss Spicer was compelled to begin the subject that
was resting heavily on her mind, without help from the
waiting maid.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“You are quite sure, Ellen, that there is no mistake
about the arrests,” she said, at length.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Post was holding up the wreath from which a cloud
of tulle floated to the floor, and did not answer for half a
minute, but she spoke at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure, Miss Spicer, of course I am. The young man,
Boyce, came round and told us the minute it was done.
They first took up the boy, then walked the old woman off
between two policemen. Boyce waited to see it done, then
come to inform Mr. Mahone, who is anxious beyond anything,
knowing that our wedding depends on their being
safely locked in prison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your wedding, Ellen, pray what has that to do with
it?” questioned Miss Spicer, who was not entirely informed
of the wheels within wheels which revolved in the kitchen
department.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as much as the five thousand dollars that you are
to pay over for clearing these people out of the madam’s
path.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you depend on that; but it will take some time
before they can be safely disposed of, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are in prison this minute; by to-morrow, at farthest,
they will be remanded—that is the word Mr. Mahone
calls it—back for trial. That ought to be disgrace enough
for one family, Miss Spicer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But this money was to be paid on conviction, Ellen, you
must remember that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I do not,” answered the waiting maid, casting
aside her veil and entering into the subject with spirit, “and
if you take it so, it isn’t too late to draw back. The young
man Boyce has only to clear out of the city, and they’ll
have to be acquitted. Everything depends on him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer changed color and gave the fragments of silks
and laces around her a spiteful toss to the floor. Her love
of money was almost as warm as her attachment for young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Lambert, or her dislike of Eva Laurence. She had, in fact,
promised this large sum of money with a reserved hope of
evading the payment after her vengeance was secured.
But Ellen Post was not exactly the person to be so dealt
with. She had no abiding faith in the honor of her confederate,
and was resolved that the trust should not be all on
one side. Another reason, still more urgent, gave her courage
to be firm. Ellen had met with disappointments in her
life, and she was in haste to secure herself from a mournful
repetition of them by wearing the snow-white robe at the
earliest possible moment. Before she could do that, the
money which Miss Spicer had promised must be forthcoming.
Mahone had expressed himself very decidedly on that
point.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It seems to me,” said Miss Spicer, “that you and your
friends are going off from the terms of our agreement,
Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not at all,” answered the bride. “Mr. Mahone is the
very soul of honor. At first he declined to act without
the money in hand, but a word from me was enough to persuade
him into waiting till these persons were in prison.
Then,” says he, “dearly as I love you, Ellen, superior as
you are to all other women, I must be firm; for your own
dear sake. I should be prepared to support you like the lady
you are. For this reason I must have the money down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There was no resisting an argument put in this complimentary
way, Miss Spicer. It went at once to the heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think it was rather intended to go to my pocket,”
answered the young lady with a short, sneering laugh. “So
if I do not pay the money down your Mr. Mahone will
allow these people to escape. Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am inclined to think that was Mr. Mahone’s meaning,”
answered Ellen, holding up her veil again and admiring
it with her head on one side like a heron looking at his
shadow in the water. “But it was all for my sake, so you
must not think hard of him.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Miss Post, my Ellen!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The voice which uttered these words came from the
kitchen out of which a door opened. Then Mr. Mahone
appeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your Adonis,” said Miss Spicer with a short laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” answered Ellen, innocently, “his name is Mahone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg pardon,” said the footman, advancing into the
room, “I thought this young lady was alone. Boyce has
just come in, would you like to speak with him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen looked at Miss Spicer, who nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He can come in if you desire,” said Ellen with dignity,
“but first allow me to put these garments out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Directly the footman entered the room again, followed by
Boyce, who presented himself with an air of mingled awkwardness
and audacity that would have excited either anger
or ridicule in Miss Spicer at any other time; now her mind
was occupied with the business in hand, so she watched
him with keen interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This young man has brought me word that the person
whom you take so much interest in is safe in prison and will
be examined to-day,” said Mahone, addressing Ellen, but
looking at the young lady. “He has just come from the
Tombs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then they are both shut up, the mother and the boy,”
said Ellen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s so,” answered Boyce, seating himself on the
edge of a chair and crushing his hat with both hands,
“salt can’t save ’em after this. They’ve got to go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then these poor creatures are certainly in prison?”
questioned the young lady, breaking out of all prudent
bounds when she thought her vengeance on the fair way to
completion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No mistake about that, Miss, you’d a thought so if you
had seen how they took on—affecting, I can tell you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>enough to bring tears from a common ball. Almost snivelled
myself, if you’ll excuse the word, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then it is certain?” questioned Miss Spicer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As bolts and bars can make it,” said Mahone. “This
young man’s evidence is enough to convict a born angel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I have given it—and shall have to give it again—nothing
but cutting loose and running away can stop that,”
said the youth, adding the last sentence in reply to a wink
from Mahone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you very much,” said Ellen Post, dismissing the
grocer’s clerk as if she had been an Empress. “I took an
interest in these people on account of the boy, but if they
are really guilty, of course all sympathy ends.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Guilty, I should think so,” answered Boyce, getting
himself up from the chair, “good morning—good morning
Miss. I hope I have not intruded nor nothing?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good morning,” said Ellen blandly, as became a not
very young lady so near the hymenial altar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mahone followed Boyce from the room, and the two men
held some moments of eager conversation in the farthest
corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did I do it up brown?” questioned the younger man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That you did,” answered the other. “Jared, I always
have said you were a trump.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is best, every word of it is true. I’m going
down to the court now. The young lady has only got the
news a little in advance. Good-bye, old boy. I’ll come up
and give you particulars when it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye, and see that you make no blunders,” answered
Mahone, “they would be too costly just now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I say,” said Boyce, coming back a step or two, “don’t
take the screws off from that rich girl in there. Nail her
before we are in too deep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, never fear, Ellen will do that,” answered Mahone,
and the two parted.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Meanwhile Ellen Post was proving herself worthy of the
confidence Mr. Mahone expressed in her. The moment those
two young men left the room she turned to Miss Spicer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now are you satisfied, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, that the work you undertook is half done,”
answered the young lady tartly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One thing is certain,” replied Miss Post quietly resuming
her work, “the money we depended on must be paid within
an hour, or that young man will come up missing at the
examination.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer started to her feet, and flushed angrily, feeling
herself coarsely coerced.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellen Post, I have made you a promise and it shall be
performed. It seems that we cannot trust each other. Let
that young man go on and I will pay you half the money
now, the rest when these people are convicted, not a cent
more. Take your choice, a check for two thousand five
hundred now, the rest to abide the result of a trial, or
nothing. Which will you have?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The check,” said Ellen Post, still going on with her
work with a leisurely motion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer left the room without a word. Ellen Post
worked faster, and her needle flew. This was all the sign
of excitement that she gave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Directly the young lady came down again with a check
fluttering in her hand. She flung it into the waiting maid’s
lap.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will that do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen took the check up, and examined it closely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it will do,” she said, “thanks!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer flung herself out of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moment she was gone, Ellen Post dropped her work
in a white heap on the carpet, and opened the kitchen door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The footman answered the call of his lady love promptly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>She closed the door and held up the check. He flushed
crimson with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t say so!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is all we shall get till after the trial,” said Ellen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me look at it,” entreated Mr. Mahone, reaching out
his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, the ink is wet,” answered his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, but when—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mahone hesitated, some coward thought, which might
have been conscience in another man, checked the criminal
proposition he was about to make.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you ask anything?” inquired Ellen, slowly folding
the check which she hid carefully away in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I did, Miss Post. What are we a waiting for?
how long will you keep this ardent heart on the fence?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Mahone, you speak so metaphorically that I can’t
quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When—when are we to be married—to unite our fortunes
and share and share alike?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Post cast down her eyes and began to roll up one of
her cap strings, feeling herself to be a young lady of romance
with an ardent hero before her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When will that confounded—that gorgeous wedding
dress be done?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It—it can be finished in an hour,” faltered the damsel,
“I was just fastening flowers into the bridal veil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then what is in the way? Who is to hinder us from
being married this very night?” demanded the lover whom
a single glimpse of that check had rendered half frantic
with greed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-night! Oh! Mr. Mahone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, this very night. The dress is ready—I have got
what would amount to a basket of champagne stored away,
and my heart—my heart!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t! don’t appeal to me in that way; you know my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>weakness, you know how impossible it is to refuse you anything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that so? Prove it then, Ellen, prove it by having
that dress on at eight o’clock this evening. I will have a
carriage at the back entrance, and a minister ready. Promise
now; if your love for me is the genuine thing, you will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Mahone, I promise!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At eight, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At eight you will find me here waiting.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVIII.<br> <span class='large'>MOTHER AND SON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When Mrs. Laurence heard this wild cry from her boy,
she turned suddenly and held out her arms. The poor little
fellow rushed into them, and clung to her, trembling under
a fierce effort to be brave and choke back the tears that
rushed, hot and painful, to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to this moment the old woman had been too indignant
for sorrow. The grey of her eyes shone out hard and
cold as steel; but now a mist stole over them and her whole
frame shook visibly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“James! James! there, there, hush! These men must
not see you cry. You have done nothing. I have done
nothing. Be brave then, as your mother is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James drew his head back, and looked in the old woman’s
face, shaking the tears away from his own vision that he
might comfort her with an effort to obey and be strong.
But the sight of that pale, shocked countenance brought
them back with a rush.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, mother! mother! what will they do to you?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“How can we tell, my child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the girls, Ruthy and Eva, will they bring them
too?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The old woman shook her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. How can I?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are they—oh! where are they, mother?” cried
the boy, startled with a new fear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At home. I left them safe—don’t, don’t tremble so,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did I tremble? Mother, don’t mind, I didn’t mean
to; only I was so frightened about the girls. Do they
mean to kill us all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, come, little chap. Don’t you see that we’re
waiting? A little of this sort of thing is well enough; but
you’re wanted up yonder, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The policeman who said this took James by the arm, not
altogether unkindly, and moved toward a flight of stairs
that led into the front of the most gloomy building that
civilization ever invented.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through dark corridors, narrow passages, and sparsely
furnished rooms, the officers led mother and son, who, quite
unconscious of crime, felt all the shame and bitter humiliation
of guilt. Through those vast Egyptian pillars that
seemed strong enough to bear up mountains, and whose
very shadows lay like overthrown granite upon the paved
floor, they went, growing more and more heavy-hearted into
that stone wilderness, till, at last, they stood in a square
room, with a desk running across one end, and some wooden
benches along the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman and her son sat down on the nearest bench,
while the officer leaned his back against the wall and
waited.</p>

<p class='c006'>The widow looked around with a vague feeling of curiosity.
The bare room, in another place, would hardly have
challenged notice; but here, in the heart of that gloomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>prison, thoughts of crime and its gloomy train of sorrows
made the place desolate indeed. The Judge, who sat wearily
on his bench, scarcely looked that way when the door
opened to admit these two prisoners. He had become so
accustomed to human suffering, so familiar with every
aspect of crime, that both had ceased to shock him.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a little, he beckoned to the officer, who came forward
and answered a brief question put to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is,” said he, “an old woman and her son, charged
with a heavy crime, the boy with grand larceny, the woman
with receiving the goods he had stolen, probably at her own
suggestion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Judge cast a severe glance at the woman, and went
on with some business that had occupied him before the
officer’s entrance.</p>

<p class='c006'>But few persons were in the court-room, for scenes like
this were commonplace affairs, and men had scarcely the
curiosity to look twice, when the mother and son seated
themselves on the same bench with some half dozen other
persons, gloomy, hardened and evil-looking, who awaited
examination.</p>

<p class='c006'>After awhile, the Judge leaned back in his leathern chair,
and the officer was ordered to come forward with his charge.
He spoke kindly to the old woman, who arose, tall, rigid
and tearless, to obey. This woman knew herself to be innocent,
and felt the wrong that had dragged her before that
tribunal with bitter, even fierce resentment. When her
hand clutched the railing before the Judge, it was with
a grasp of iron, and the eyes she bent upon him burned
with smouldering fire which he took for defiance.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the judge called Mrs. Laurence by name, the lad
clung to her dress, and followed her up to the bar, with
some wild idea of protecting her from the harm that threatened
them both.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there was nothing for him to do. He understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>that some wrong was intended, but had no idea of the form
in which it was to come upon them. Thus he stood close
to his mother, pale and bewildered.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had given him no chance to speak to his mother,
nor did he know of what she was accused. All was gloom
and distrust around him; his proud young heart swelled
with a sense of infinite degradation, which seemed to close
in his life with sudden darkness. He turned his eyes upon
the judge with thrills of dread, then lifted them to his
mother, from whose face they fell away, heavy with tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the mother and her boy stood before this, to them
mysterious tribunal, two men came into the court-room, and
James gave a start as he saw them, and uttered a faint cry,
which drew his mother’s attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first man who presented himself was Jared Boyce,
who came forward with a studied swagger, though his
usually florid face was almost ashen pale, and his cowardly
eyes wandered away from any look fixed upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other man was Smith; he too was pale and greatly
agitated; he only cast one glance at the lad, whose face
brightened at the sight of him, and turned utterly away
from the woman, who searched his countenance keenly with
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, sir! oh, Mr. Smith! what does it mean? What
will they do with her?” half sobbed, half whispered the
boy, who still considered Smith his friend, and drew closer
to him in an agony of hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>Smith turned away with a frown; his course was taken;
justice should be done; why then should he permit himself
to be disturbed by the woman’s stern glance, or the large,
pleading eyes of the boy. Now and then, he glanced toward the door, as if apprehending something from that
quarter. But the fixed resolve of his face did not change.
He waved the poor lad back with his hand, but made no
other reply to his pathetic appeal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Oh, mother, what can I do for you—what can I do?”
cried the boy, creeping back to the old woman’s side.
“Everybody turns against us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush! be a man!” was the answer; but the old woman’s
voice was broken and her mouth quivered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do they mean to send us back to prison, mother?” This
time the boy addressed the policeman who had all along
betrayed extraordinary pity for him. But another person
heard it and answered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not as long as I live to say that it sha’nt be done,
Jimmy dear!”</p>

<p class='c006'>James sprang forward and caught Mrs. Smith by the
gown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, ma’am, you will take her away, you will—” Mrs.
Smith interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I will, if it kills me I will!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the good woman released her dress from the boy’s
grasp and went up to the judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir,” said she, “now may it please your honor, I have
come down here all alone to see that justice is done to these
two people who are innocent as milk, yes sir, as skim milk.
They are my friends, neither of them ever touched the
value of a pin that I didn’t give them with my own hand.
They——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The judge here interrupted an argument that would have
been effective before a jury, and in its honest intensity
interested him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who are you, Madam? I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who am I? Yesterday I should have been proud to
say I was that man’s wife, but now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here poor Mrs. Smith cast a reproachful glance on her
husband; burst into a passion of tears, and only answered
the judge with her sobs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is my wife,” said Smith, in a troubled voice, “and
won’t believe in their guilt, though the goods were found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>that woman’s wood-house. Some of them was in the
cellar. The officers can testify to that, but she won’t believe
a word of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I won’t, there!” cried the woman, brushing away
a fresh burst of tears, and turning upon her husband, “not
if I’d seen them a doing it with my own eyes. There are
things, Mr. Judge, that human nature won’t take in, and
this is one of them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know anything about this charge of your own
knowledge?” questioned the Judge kindly, for the woman’s
generous recklessness had made its impression on him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Know, Mr. Judge. Yes, I know that it’s a shame and
a disgrace that we shall never get over as long as my name
is Smith. Why, sir, if you could have seen that boy tending
my Jerusha Maria, his innocence would be clear as clear
to you. No paid nurse was ever so careful or so handy—the
way he used to hold up her two feet in them red morocco
shoes for her to crow over, was a sight in itself. He steal.
He rob a store—nothing but a heathen would think of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Smith turned upon her husband, and flashed a
storm of wrathful glances on him from her yet tearful eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a pretty man, ain’t you—an honor to the name
of Smith, oh yes! It would make you happy to see these
two innocent creatures in States Prison, with balls and
chains on their ankles. I can see you now a gloating over
it, and those two girls breaking their hearts. Oh, Smith!
Smith! I wouldn’t have believed it of you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there, my good lady, I can honor your feelings,
but you interrupt the case. Pray step down and let me take
the evidence of these persons,” said the Judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you won’t believe them, just promise that you
won’t believe them, and I’ll be still enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Believe me, they shall have justice,” answered the
judge, kindly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is all any of us want,” said Mrs. Smith, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>stepping down, she took her place by Mrs. Laurence, resolute
to stand by her to the last.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Young man, step this way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jared Boyce obeyed this order from the magistrate, and
mounted the step which ran in front of the judge’s seat.
His face was flushed to a bricky red now, and his eyes wandered
away from any one who attempted to look into them.
They were turned furtively aside from the judge while Boyce
told his story in a hard, cruel voice, which never faltered or
softened in its tone from beginning to end. We know what
that story was, and how the wicked plot to ruin this brave,
innocent lad had grown and perfected itself in the craft and
greed of a few base creatures, who at first thought only of
throwing their own guilt on him, but afterwards broadened
their plot in hopes of great future gain.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was impossible for Boyce to keep the blood from receding
now and then from his face. When that stern woman’s
eyes were bent on him, he seemed to feel their searching
fire, and grew deadly pale, though his glance never rested
on her once. Two or three times the accused lad made a
step or two forward, with his hand clenched, tempted to
strike his fellow clerk for the slander he was uttering; but
a touch of the old woman’s hand brought him back to her
side, and the perjured wretch told his story to the end, without
interruption of any kind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIX.<br> <span class='large'>THE EXAMINATION COMPLETED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then Smith the grocer took the stand. There was human
feeling in this man, and he bitterly repented the step
he had taken after his wife learned of it, and put in her passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>protest. But compunction came too late. His charge
had been made; the case was taken out of his hands. He
would gladly have softened, or withheld his own evidence;
but the oath enforced upon him was a sacred obligation to
speak the truth, and against his own will Smith gave in his
evidence honestly.</p>

<p class='c006'>While he was speaking a gentleman came into the court-room,
and quietly drew toward Mrs. Laurence and her son,
who caught him by the hand and whispered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, take her home! don’t let her stand here to be looked
at so! Feel her hands; they are cold as stones! Let
them take me. I am a man, and can bear it; but a night in
one of those cells would kill any woman! Please, oh, please!
We haven’t another friend on earth but Mrs. Smith and
you, since he has turned against us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here James cast a look full of mournful reproach on Smith,
whose voice began to falter, and once more he besought permission
to withdraw the charge and let these two helpless
creatures go. Guilty as they were, he did not like to see
them punished.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the old woman advanced toward the judge and
spoke. It was the first time she had uttered anything but
dry, hard monosyllables, since her entrance into the court-room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you are to decide this,” she said, firmly; but still
with respect, “I ask that this man shall show us no mercy
that can leave a suspicion of wrong on me, or on my boy.
If you are a just judge, search out the truth, find the guilty
persons; first and foremost wring the perjury from that
young man’s soul, for he <i>is</i> perjured.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce tried to evade the long, steady finger which the
woman pointed at him; but there was a force and weird
fascination in her look which held him motionless. He grew
coldly white to the lips, and the ruddy hair rose upon his
temples like meadow-grass lifted by the wind.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“That—that is libelous,” he faltered at last. “I only
come to do my duty, and because Mr. Smith wanted me
to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I just wish I hadn’t; that’s all,” said Smith, wiping
his moist forehead. “I’d rather have lost twice the
money, than go through with all this again; to say nothing
of the awful muss at home, where I don’t know as my own
wife will speak to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you never fear that—they always do!” said Boyce,
with an uneasy attempting to shake off the impression
which Mrs. Laurence had left upon him. “Shouldn’t wonder
if she forgives you one of these days, hard as she takes
it; women are, naturally—well, suppose we say, soft.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Silence!” said the judge, on whom the young man
was fastening a vague suspicion of treachery. “Come forward,
Mrs. Laurence, and make your own statement.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence laid her hand on the railing before her,
looked the judge steadily in the face, and answered that she
had nothing to say, except that, up to the time of her arrest
she had never heard of the robbery, or known that her son
was suspected.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But some of the goods were found on your premises.
How do you account for that?” said the judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not account for a thing of which I have no knowledge.
If stolen property was found there, neither I nor
this child had anything to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you deny all knowledge of the stolen goods found
in the out-house on your premises?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the boy? Step down. He may be able to tell us
something. James Laurence!”</p>

<p class='c006'>James came forward, pale and frightened; but in no way
downcast; his eyes clear, honest, and limpid with truth,
were lifted almost with confidence to the judge, whose face
softened with an irresistible feeling of compassion as he bent
it toward him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“Tell me what you know of this,” he said, very kindly;
“but first let me caution you. If you are the guilty boy this
witness makes you out, I have no power or right to make
you accuse yourself. Be careful what you say; innocent or
guilty, you shall have a fair trial.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will answer everything, only please tell me what is it
you want to know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have heard the charge. You know what this
young man has been saying. Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir, I heard every word he said. Some of it was
true, and some wasn’t,” answered the boy, lifting his honest
eyes to the magistrate’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much of it, then, was true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He did give me the store key, sir, and I was left home
to take care of things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the boy faltered a little, and his eyes fell, his manly
little heart refused to own that he was left in care of a girl
baby before all those people.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what did you do after that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tried to fasten the door inside, but the bar was gone,
so I left it as it was, locked but not barred, and went up
stairs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who was with you then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one, that is, no one but Jerusha Maria. Kate Gorman
had gone out with Jared Boyce, and we two were
locked in till our folks came home from the party.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And who is Jerusha Maria? Is she here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>James glanced at Mrs. Smith, and answered, with hesitation,
that Jerusha Maria was Mrs. Smith’s little girl, and
couldn’t come to a place like that, not being old enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But being that bright,” broke in the mother, “that if
she was here, she would cry ready to break her heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The magistrate smiled, but went on questioning James.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what did you do after that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I sat down by Jerusha Maria, and tried to coax her to
go to sleep,” faltered the lad, blushing crimson.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“Well, what next?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She wouldn’t do it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Being good as gold, but obstinate, taking after her
father in that respect,” broke in Mrs. Smith, with a last
dash of scorn at her husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They had kept up a racket before going out,” said
James; “and that left her wide awake. It wasn’t her
fault.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll be bound it wasn’t!” exclaimed the mother, with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?” said the judge, silencing Mrs. Smith with a
gesture of the hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, sir, I—I sat down by her and rocked the cradle
till she fell asleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor boy confessed this with a glow of burning
shame in his eyes and cheeks; it was the only thing in his
young life that he shrank from making known; the great
cross taken up to save his mother and sisters from starvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, when the child was asleep—what next?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I drank a glass of root beer that tasted of paregoric,
and went to sleep myself. It was wrong, but I could not
help it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you woke up again?” said the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not till the folks came home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And this is all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is all I can remember about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The magistrate hesitated; there was something so straightforward
and honest in the two persons brought before him,
that some intuitive feeling made him suspicious of the evidence
that seemed to condemn them. But there was, in
fact, nothing to contradict it; nothing that could justify
him in setting the prisoners free. While he hesitated, there
arose a slight disturbance at the door of the court-room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LX.<br> <span class='large'>AN UNEXPECTED WITNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A young woman, evidently of the working classes, was
talking eagerly with a policeman, stationed at the door of
the court-room, which disturbed the judge, who looked that
way with an expression of annoyance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce also gazed anxiously around; a deadly whiteness
crept over his face, as he looked for some other door by
which he might hope to escape. None presented itself.
Rendered desperate by fear, he hurried toward the woman,
and attempted to pass her, forcing a ghastly smile to his
lips, calling her by name, and saying, with airy lightness,
that he wished to speak with her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman turned upon him fiercely. He saw that her
eyes were heavy with weeping, and her whole face flushed
with angry grief. Every nerve in his body quivered; the
breath stopped in his throat. He could not have maintained
that jaunty air a moment longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come along! I have lots to say to you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say it to him!” answered the woman, pointing toward
the policeman. “He will go with you, I dare say. I have
got business in here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Business! You? What? What business?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come back, and you’ll hear. At any rate, I’m not
afraid of you going far. Make sure that you’ll be wanted!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean, woman? Are you going back on
your own husband?” gasped the frightened wretch, in a
hoarse whisper. “Are you, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not yet,” answered the woman. “But no wonder you
think so, for I’m going to do a queer thing for once!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What? What is that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to speak the truth, and shame—Well, no
matter.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Mary!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes! That’s my name. Mary Boyce. Tell Mr. Mahone
that the old name is good enough for me and my baby;
but then we don’t wear French caps and pink streamers,
and no young lady is yearning to give me five thousand dollars
for disgracing innocent people! Such things don’t
often come in the way of a poor woman, who goes out to
day’s washing to support herself and her child, besides
handing over her hard earnings to the man who wants to
leave her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mary! Mary! Listen to me! You are mistaken!
Some wicked person has been telling you lies!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce caught his sister-in-law by the arm, driven frantic
by her words.</p>

<p class='c006'>She tore herself from his hold, and hurrying up to the
judge, broke in upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir! Yer honor! I know all about this case! That
young man standing there is Jared Boyce, my husband’s
brother. Swear me, please. Let me tell the story with my
hand on the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let her be sworn,” said the judge; and the woman
who had been engaged for extra help in Mrs. Lambert’s
laundry laid her hand on the Bible and kissed it reverently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now,” said the magistrate, “what is it you wish me to
hear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman answered promptly and under considerable
excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was my husband and that copper-headed scamp that
robbed Mr. Smith’s store. They two planned it weeks and
weeks ago; but it was not till Smith took a new boy on,
that they could make anything of a haul. They did it together.
My own husband, who is a footman in Fifth
Avenue, only he goes by another name, expects that will
carry him through bigamy and burglary, and everything
else bad that begins with a B. In short, sir, only this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>morning, going out to my day’s work, as innocent as a
lamb, thinking my husband was at his place down town,
where females couldn’t come, though I never saw a smithereen
of his money—not I. Well, yer honor, I went to me
day’s work in a new place, being on account of another
woman’s not being well, and there I finds my own husband
making up to a creature that yer honor wouldn’t wipe
your shoes on, saving yer presence, and she calling him Mr.
Mahone, and talking about a wedding dress that stands
alone with richness, and a Miss Spicer, who wants eternal
and everlasting disgrace to fall on a family by the name of
Laurence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, yer honor, the long and the short of it is this entirely.
Jared Boyce and his brother, me own lawfully wedded
husband, robbed Mr. Smith’s store, both of groceries and
money, which they divided atween them, in my own room,
and the groceries they packed away under my bed and in
the closet, and me saying nothing, till they come one night
and carried them away; so I, being put about by this, followed
after them, and, with my own eyes, saw Jared and
me husband hide the groceries and other things away in a
wood-house back of a little place where I afterwards saw
yon woman going in and out as if she belonged there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, yer honor, I said nothing about that, but minded
me work, and keeping the baby nice in hopes it might ’tice
me husband home more, wondering what it all meant, when
I found out behind that close-horse in the laundry what
was going on in them underground rooms, where servants
set up for ladies; I just wiped the soap suds from my arms,
put on my bit of a hood and foregathered awhile with a
policeman that stands on our corner, about the best way of
telling the truth and keeping me husband from that prowling
lion with the cap, and it please your honor, he told me
to come down here, and never fear that your honor wouldn’t
give Robert a taste of Blackwell’s Island which I hope you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>will, just enough to set him straight and keep him out of
the way of females in caps till he turns to his own lawfully
married wife and child. That is all I ask your honor, and
if you don’t believe me, just send some one up to me little
place and I’ll show him a chist of tea and a box of crackers
that they left with me, besides other things just to pacify
me for taking off the rest, which I didn’t like at all, not
always having tea and such things in the house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Boyce was interrupted by the Judge, who
pointed towards the door, and in a stern voice ordered the
officer to stop that man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man was Jared Boyce, who had been making sickly
efforts to slink out of sight, while his sister-in-law was giving
her evidence. He had crept up to the door through
which he was about to make a desperate plunge just as the
Judge observed him. Terrified and shaking from head to
foot, the poor wretch muttered that he wasn’t meaning to
go out, and retreated to the nearest bench, where his limbs
shrunk together, and his face grew more and more livid, as
the woman rambled on with her evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your honor,” said she, “I don’t want yez to be hard
on my Robert. A week at Blackwell’s Island will be
plenty to bring him to his sinses and make an honest man
and dutiful husband of him. But as for the woman who
was tempting him into unlawful bigermy, as the perliceman
calls it; twenty years wouldn’t be too much for her, with
plinty of hard work at the wash-tub, and bread and water
to live on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Boyce was preparing to step down from the
witness stand but turned back again, having thought of
something else.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was that female, your honor, that set him on to parsecute
this woman, that never says a word or cries a tear
more an if she was made of stone, yer honor; and it was
her that put him up to marrying her ownself before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>priest, so ye cannot give the crather too much punishment,
which is all I have to say, that I think of now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Having thus expressed her wishes, Mrs. Boyce came down
from the witness stand with a look of triumph on the face
that had been stained with tears when she went up; for she
had great faith in her own eloquence, and entertained no
doubt that the judge would kindly deal out justice exactly
as she had recommended, for he had seemed deeply interested,
and smiled more than once while she was giving her
evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the woman’s countenance fell when she saw Jared
crouching on his bench, pale and shivering with dread of
the fate her words had prepared for him. She went up to
him, with a little hesitation, and was about to assure him of
her protection, but he glared upon her like a wild beast, and
turned his face to the wall, muttering hoarsely,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get out of my sight, you fool! It is in States Prison
for years you’ve put me and your own husband this day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman was struck dumb by his words; the color left
her face to its natural wan misery. She looked wildly
around toward the judge, who was talking with the tall
gentleman who had entered the court-room so quietly. She
looked again at Boyce, and in a broken, piteous voice besought
him to tell her the truth, would the judge be so cruel
after all she had said to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cruel, you idiot! he can’t help himself,” answered the
clerk, livid with malice and cowardly dread, “you’ve done
for me, and you’ve done for your own husband.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, it’s wanting to break my heart ye are, just out
of spite; but I don’t believe ye. It’s the woman he’ll send
up yonder.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The woman, he can’t touch her!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! what is it ye say.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That woman will carry her head high as ever, while you
are worse than a widow, that’s what I say.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“A widdy—me a widdy, whist now, Jared, it’s jokin’ ye
are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Joking,” repeated the clerk, bitterly, “It seems like a
joke, don’t it? They are making out the warrants now,
but I can tell you this, for your comfort. Robert will be
married before they can reach him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Married! To that woman?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To that woman.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more Mrs. Boyce rushed before the judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yer honor—”</p>

<p class='c006'>The judge waved her back, he was giving orders about
some papers that a clerk was writing out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, yer honor,” persisted the distracted creature.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can go home now, my good woman. The officer
will let you know when you are wanted again,” said the
judge, without lifting his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor woman looked wildly around the court-room, but
there was no one to whom she could appeal. Then struck
with the thought that her husband was perhaps being
married, she rushed from the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was nearly dark when this poor wife, stung with regret
for what she had done, and tortured with dread, reached the
vicinity of Mrs. Lambert’s dwelling. She dared not attempt
to go in, but walked up and down the block, keeping
the servants’ entrance in view all the time. Once or twice
she passed a police officer who seemed watching like herself,
but shunned him with trembling dread. What did he want
there, and who was he waiting for?</p>

<p class='c006'>After it became quite dark, the poor woman lingered in
sight of the house. She had walked all the way down to
the Tombs and back again, her limbs were weary, her heart
ached with apprehension. Oh, if she could only see her
husband one moment to warn him of the danger her own
ignorance had brought upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman grew desperate, she could pace that side-walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>no longer. It was quite dark and her child would be crying
with hunger; at any rate she would ring at the servants
door.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Mrs. Boyce was advancing for that purpose a carriage
drove up. She hesitated and drew back into a shadow of
the garden wall. The policeman was near her, but she was
too much absorbed to observe him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Directly the door opened and two persons came out.
One a figure in flowing white garments that gleamed like
snow across the darkness; the other a man. There was a
pause near the carriage, and the woman was close enough to
hear every word these two persons said. The woman drew
back and seemed to hesitate about entering the carriage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your friend is not here; we cannot proceed without
him; there must be witnesses,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we shall find them at the minister’s,” pleaded the
man. “I don’t pretend to know what keeps my friend
Boyce, but one witness is as good as another; do step in, or
we shall be late.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post had her foot on the step and was gathering
the bridal veil about her, when a strange hand was laid on
her arm, and the face of Mrs. Boyce gleamed on her with
the lamp light full upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Woman, go back into the house, take off them white
things and ask God to forgive you. This man is my own
lawfully wedded husband.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The deep, honest feeling of the wife gave dignity to her
speech. Ellen Post stepped back and stood gazing on her,
pale and breathless.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who are you? What does this mean?” she faltered
at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am this man’s wife, that’s what I am, and we have
one child, which you can see any day if you will come to
my place, Ellen Post.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe it. Mahone, Mahone, come here and tell
this woman she lies.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Oh Robert, Robert, run for your life. Jared is in
prison; they will be after you,” pleaded the poor wronged
wife. “Don’t wait for anything, but go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why don’t you speak? Why don’t you deny this?”
demanded Ellen Post, stamping her whitely-clad foot on
the side-walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The gentleman has something else to do,” answered the
strange voice of a man who had quietly drawn near and
laid his hand on Mahone’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Robert Boyce, you must go with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A policeman!” faltered the bride, “what does this
mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A policeman,” moaned the wife; “oh Robert, Robert,
say you forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Boyce turned his wild eyes from his wife to the officer,
and stared a moment in the man’s face. Then he made a
sudden twist, wrenched himself free, and made a bound forward—one
bound and the heavy hand grasped his shoulder
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before either of the women could speak, Robert Boyce
was led off into the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXI.<br> <span class='large'>WAITING FOR NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There is not, upon the face of the earth, more harassing
trouble than that which springs out of ignorance and suspense.
Eva and Ruth Laurence had but a wild and vague
idea of the evil that had fallen on the two most beloved
members of their little household. They knew nothing of
the law, and imprisonment to them was an awful blending
of suffering and disgrace, to which the unchecked imagination
lent unknown horrors.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>They sat together for a time in dead silence, each afraid
to speak, lest she should add something to the distress of
the other. But, as time wore on, this stillness became
intolerable. Eva sprang to her feet and began to walk the
room, with the wild restless tread of a panther in its cage;
while Ruth clasped both slender hands over her bosom, and
let the tears run unchecked, from under her closed eyelids.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Ruth, Ruth! what must we do!” cried out Eva,
wringing her hands and wrenching them apart with impetuous
force. “I cannot stay here waiting in this way; <i>he</i>
ought not to ask it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what can we do? Ah, me! how helpless we poor
girls are!” said Ruth, opening her eyes, and wiping away
the tears with her trembling hand. “Even your strength
would be wasted, and I am so weak.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if I had something to lift—some great load to carry—sister,
sister, I can believe now how ready persecuted women
were to walk, unshod, among hot ploughshares. I
could do it to save them and bring them back to us safe.
I could! I could!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My sister, my own, own Eva, be patient. It would be
only wasted strength if you could do all this; be patient and
wait!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait, wait! that is a woman’s destiny in this world,”
said Eva, with passionate vehemence; “but how can we—how
can we? The pain of it is driving me wild!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Remember,” answered Ruth, speaking softly in her
sweet patience, “we have a strong, good man at work for
us. Is there no strength and hope in that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I want to do something; I must, I must.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear Eva, what can you do? Is it nothing that we
have already won such a friend? have patience, sister.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Patience, Ruth, I have nothing but apprehension and
fear. Think of her, our mother, so still, so proud. Yes,
yes, the proudest woman I ever saw, with all our poverty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and struggles; think of her in the hands of a policeman—in
a cell of the tombs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do think of it, and it leaves me weak as a child; but
Eva, there is a God above.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva turned away from the sweet invalid with a gesture
of sharp impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet our mother, and the dearest, brightest, noblest boy
that ever lived, are forced from their homes, and innocent as
angels, dragged like wolves through our streets. I cannot
understand it; I <i>cannot</i> understand it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva, Eva, have some faith in the justice of God, in
the energy and goodness of this man who has already done
so much for us. I am sure he will bring them back
again!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the time lengthens so. It is hours and hours since
she was taken away! All night long that poor child has
been shut up in a prison. Oh, it is terrible!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, here is something; a carriage stops at the door.
It brings us news, good or bad,” cried Ruth, now as much
excited as her sister. “Run to the door, Eva.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva had already sprung into the little entry, opened the
door and met Mrs. Smith half way from the gate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, what is it? Where are they?” she enquired,
breathless with dread and impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith took the girl in her arms and kissed her,
leaving a stain of tears on her cheek.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be afraid; don’t be anxious. They’ll both be
here in less than no time; I jumped into a hack which
Smith will have to pay for, thank goodness, and made the
driver hurry up his horses to an extent that they will never
think of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then they are free? they are coming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Free as birds, and coming along full split, no mistake
about that. They wanted me to take the empty seat, but I
had not the face to do it after Smith’s conduct; though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>did melt right down and try to back out when he saw how
I took on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>By the time this stream of words had heralded the good
woman’s news, she was in the parlor, had half lifted Ruth
from her couch, and was lavishing hearty kisses on her pale
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has happened? what did they do down there?
No wonder you want to know all about it. Well, I went
straight down to the Tombs, which is just the lonesomest
pile of stones inside, that you ever set eyes on; pillars like
them Sampson carried off on his shoulders, and stone rooms
that chill one like graves. Well, I wandered about among
them hunting up your mother and that precious boy, till I
found them at last in a room full of benches with a short
counter along one end, and a man sitting behind it, and
there stood your mother looking stern and gray as a rock in
the winter, and there was little Jimmy a standing by her
with his big eyes full of tears, which he kept wiping away,
for fear folks might see him cry, poor darling; and that
fellow Boyce had been telling his lies, and Smith was backing
him up, and things looked awful cloudy till I up and
had my say, though Smith was standing there wanting to
stop me, and Mr. Ross, my friend Mrs. Carter’s brother,
come in and stood by your mother like a monument. But
I would have my say, and I did.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t any doubt, girls, that this speech of mine did
the business; but another woman came in and finished up
the whole thing. She was Jared Boyce’s brother’s wife.
And they did the robbing and stealing, and hid the things
in your wood-house. I wish you could have seen the scamp
Boyce, when the woman told on him; he was just as gray
as ashes, and all skimped up; you wouldn’t have known
him—anyway, I shouldn’t; and Smith is just about the
sheepiest man you ever sot eyes on, and wants me to say
how awful sorry he is, which I won’t; and what a fool he
has been, which I will.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“There, now! Didn’t I tell you! Here they come, all
in one carriage, just as good as new. Let me lift you up,
Ruthy, and you can see ’em get out, Mr. Ross and all, who
is a gentleman, if one ever lived. There, there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Trembling with joy, Ruth looked out and saw Eva darting
down the front walk with her arms extended.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little James leaped into them and clung to her neck,
covering her face with kisses; then he made a bound into
the house, and Ruth saw no more; for his arms were around
her, and his voice filled the room with its sobbing gladness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Directly Eva came in clinging to her mother, who moved
up the walk with her usual grave step, and put aside her
bonnet and shawl before she said a word. Then she came
up to Ruth, knelt by her side, and laid her head upon the
cushion like one who throws down a heavy burden and
longs to rest herself awhile.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gentle Ruth drew close to the old woman, and with tearful
kisses, softened the stony grayness of her lips, until
they began to tremble. Then her whole frame shook, and,
clinging to the girl, she cried out, “Oh, God be thanked, I
am home again!” in a voice that made every one in the
room weep; for feelings so restrained and pent up are terrible
in their force when they once break bounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith sat down in the corner of the room and cried
piteously as she took in the deep pathos of this reunion.
She had begun to soften toward her husband, accepting his
sin upon her own shoulders; and thus sat condemned before
the family he had so grievously afflicted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy James saw this, and went up to her, wiping
away the tears from his radiant eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what should we have done if you had not been our
friend?” he said; “poor mother would have been there all
alone with me; but you did not forget us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy! You will never want to live with
us again,” said the good woman.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Won’t I though!” answered the boy, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For a time,” interposed Mr. Ross; “so long as he works
for any one, Mrs. Smith; but we must put him to school and
through the City College. Don’t you think so, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What me, <i>me</i>! You don’t mean it, Mr. Ross?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do mean it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva, Ruth, mother! do you hear that? Hurra! This
morning I was in a prison-cell that seemed dug out of a
rock; and now—now I’m going to college! Why don’t
you stop crying and say Hurra! every one of you, Hurra!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXII.<br> <span class='large'>THE MORTGAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A master will had been at work and removed all the
principal reasons that kept Eva Laurence in the old home
at the cottage. James had never been permitted to return
to his work at Smith’s grocery, though that repentant man
would gladly have appeased his conscience and the wrathful
compunctions of his wife, by giving him the position so
summarily vacated by Boyce. This arrangement Mr. Ross
had frustrated, by placing James, after a short examination,
in the entering class of the City Academy, when his business
education commenced, while Boyce, with his aristocratic
brother, made a quick passage through the Court of Sessions.
This precious pair of worthies were already commencing
a sojourn of three years each at Sing Sing, to the
infinite disgust of Miss Ellen Post, and the profound grief
of the poor wife.</p>

<p class='c006'>This ill-used woman, in the first fire of jealousy, and in
the blindness of perfect ignorance, had denounced the two
men, in a vague hope that the court would have power to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>bring her husband back into the bosom of her family a better
and kinder man. How keenly she had been disappointed,
and how many bitter tears she shed over her helpless
babe, no one but the unhappy drudge herself could tell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer, too, suffered both in reputation and temper.
Her name had been roughly handled in the trial, and her
plan of disgrace for the Laurence family had recoiled on
herself. But this young lady was not of a nature to feel
the shame of this exposure keenly, or abandon a project
which she had once set her mind upon. Of course, she denied
the whole thing, and called on Ellen Post to witness
that the story told by Mrs. Boyce, and confirmed by the
two convicted men, was a fabrication from beginning to
end. Mrs. Lambert believed this, and Ivon would not permit
himself to doubt it; for to a generous and noble character
like his, the undercraft and meanness of a small nature is
simply incomprehensible.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Ellen, she was a ready witness in the young lady’s
behalf, for the check had been honored before Miss Spicer
knew of the failure of her conspiracy, and the waiting maid
was willing to make any return that did not involve the
money itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for the little episode of the wedding garments, Ellen
passed it off with an airy declaration that she had only been
altering a dress for Miss Spicer, and punished the curiosity
of her fellow servants by a canard, they were all fools for
believing.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the malice of Miss Spicer was not to be checked by a
single defeat. By some means she had learned that Mrs.
Lambert’s agent held a mortgage on the Laurence cottage,
which the harassed family had allowed to sink into an
almost hopeless amount by unpaid interest. This mortgage
she empowered her own agent to purchase and forclose at
once. It was an act of vengeance, which she hoped would
destroy all vestige of respectability which this poor household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>had struggled so hard to maintain. But even here she
was defeated ignominiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter happened to be in the Laurence parlor when
the notice of this new calamity was served upon the family.
She had called to urge once more the acceptance of her
noble offer on Eva, before going out on a shopping excursion
which was to terminate at Ball &#38; Black’s, where something
unusually splendid, in the way of a diamond bracelet, had
been offered to her attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, now, get into the carriage, and we’ll talk over
affairs as we ride along,” said the good-hearted woman,
whose desire to have Eva with her had grown into a passion.
“I’ve got Carter’s check for the bracelet, which is gorgeous,
but I want your opinion. I wish Miss Ruthy here could go
too; but she shall see it when we come back. Come, dear,
step about lively, or we shall have Battles sulking again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As Eva went to get her bonnet, two important events
happened. The notice of foreclosure was put in her hand
by a strange young man, whose ring at the bell had drawn
her to the front door, and while she was wondering what it
could mean, the postman came into the yard with a letter
from the establishment in which her duties lay. This letter
curtly dismissed her from the situation, which was forfeited,
the proprietor said, by her impertinence to Miss Spicer, a
young lady who had been a most valuable customer, and had
personally entered a complaint against her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Carrying the two documents in her hand, Eva went back
to the parlor with tears in her eyes and a throb of bitter
pain at her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me, how white you look! What is the matter?”
questioned Mrs. Carter, lifting herself from the easy-chair,
and laying her hand on Eva’s arm. “What is there in
them papers that makes you shiver so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva turned her heavy eyes upon the kind-hearted questioner.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“The letter is for me,” she said. “I’ve lost my place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lost your place? Well, I’m glad of it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is nothing. Other establishments exist; but this—this
cruel slip of paper is terrible. I think—I fear it
will turn us all out of doors! Oh, my poor mother! How
will she bear it? After all that has been put upon her, I
would rather place a serpent in her hand than this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me look at it before you do that,” said Mrs. Carter,
resolutely. “I understand these things better than any of
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without waiting for a reply, she took the paper, and read
it with an eager, cheerful look, which went to Eva’s heart.
“It is easy,” she thought, “for the rich to look on such
things as trifles; but for us! She cannot understand how
terrible it is for us!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much does all this amount to?” inquired Mrs.
Carter, with prompt energy. “Does any one know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed! indeed! we all know too well. Every cent, as
it ran up, has been counted over and over again,” said gentle
Ruth. “As to the interest, I have something toward that,
and might have earned more and more, if they would only
have given me time; but now——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor girl stopped short; tears were crowding on her
speech with such bitter force, that she clasped both hands
over her face, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There! there! None of that! It is all nonsense, you
know. What is the amount? That is the question before
the American people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva, with her eyes seeking the floor, told the sum, in a
shrill whisper; for now, when the amount was demanded,
it seemed enormous, and her lips gave it forth with a spasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>This miserable sound had scarcely left her throat, when
the little parlor was filled with mellow laughter, which
seemed to mock and overpower Ruthy’s sobs, and her sister’s
anguish.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“What, only that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only that!” exclaimed Eva, kindling with astonishment.
“It is more than enough to turn us all out of house
and home!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, my child, the lots are worth three times the money.
You have no idea how property has risen since the war.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know, and if I did, what good would it do without
a dollar in hand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No! no! Eva; I have been saving; I have got money—not
anything to what they want, but some,” cried Ruth,
wiping the tears from her eyes, which somehow began to
kindle with vague hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Ruthy! we shall want that to keep us from starving.
My place is gone; James has nothing to do! Mrs.
Carter, please give me that paper. Mother must know. It
is only cruelty to hold it back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not just yet, if you please. Bad news comes to a head
soon enough, without forcing. Go and get your things;
there will be time to settle that when we come back.
Don’t you see Battles snapping the flowers with his whip;
that shows that he is getting furious—so do make haste.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva obeyed. Perhaps she was glad to accept the respite
which Mrs. Carter offered her. Still her hands trembled as
she fastened the tiny bonnet on her head, and covered her
face with a veil, with a vain effort to hide all traces of the
tears that still welled up to her eyes, spite of all her efforts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come now, let us be off. Just keep cool, and don’t fret
yourself into a fever, till we come back,” said Mrs. Carter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>kissing Ruth before she went out, “and not a word to the
grim—I mean nice old lady in yonder. There, there, no
more sobbing—she’ll hear you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bright as a sunbeam, and full of energy, which contrasted
with Eva’s mournful lassitude, Mrs. Carter swept through
the little yard, and for once defied Battles’ evident ill-temper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Drive to Carter’s office,” she said, “and be quick about
it. Don’t dare to let the grass grow under them horses’
hoofs, when I’m in the carriage. Get in, my dear; don’t
wait for me. There now, we are ever so comfortable—you
and I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Away went the carriage at full speed, for Battles, not
daring to disobey orders entirely, resolved to vent his ill-temper
by overdoing them. At another time the sulky
coachman might have terrified the good lady within, by the
reckless speed with which he crashed into the carts and omnibuses
on his way toward Wall Street. As it was, this hidden
motive seemed nothing more than prompt obedience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell Carter to come out; I want to speak to him,” said
the lady, when Battles drew up near the office-door, and
the footman looked in for orders.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few moments, Carter came down the steps, rosy and
smiling, his heavy watch-chain swinging loosely down from
the pocket of his white vest, and the diamonds in his bosom
glistening richly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what is it?” he inquired, looking into the carriage,
and nodding kindly to Eva. “Brought the article
down for me to look at, I suppose. It is of no use; if you
like it, that’s enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter took out her reticule-purse, opened the gold
clasp, and took a scrap of paper from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just cut that in two, and give me half. I’ve changed my
mind about the bracelet. It isn’t much of an affair, after
all, that is, considering the price asked. I’ve made up my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>mind to invest in real estate. So, just cut down the check,
and let me go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Carter laughed till the diamonds in his bosom shook off
quick flashes of light.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, this is a new idea. Cut down a check half,
because one’s wife is going into real estate! Haven’t made
so much money on one job in a week. Here, come along,
you fellow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Beckoning joyously to the footman, Carter went into his
office with the check in his hand. Directly the servant
came out with the abridged paper neatly folded, which Mrs.
Carter put into her purse, and gave another order regarding
the route her carriage was to take on its way home. The
good woman got out once or twice, leaving Eva alone, and
at last came from a lawyer’s office with a folded paper in
her hand, which was hurried into her pocket, when she saw
Eva looking at it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more Battles drew up his horses at Mrs. Laurence’s
gate, and with his heavy face clouded with disgust, waited
gloomily for his mistress to go into that shanty, as he was
pleased to call it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter, oblivious of her servant’s discontent, bustled
out of her carriage. She almost lifted Eva to the ground,
and opened the gate for herself, absolutely pushing the footman
on one side, and bursting her delicate mauve glove in
the operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, my dears, you can call that mother of yours!
Don’t stop to take off your bonnet, Eva, but bring her in.
That’s right. Here she comes, looking as if she expected a
policeman. Mrs. Laurence, my dear neighbor, my darling
good woman! here is something for you; just a trifle—a
little mite of a present. Take it, and chuck it, neck and
heels, into the hottest corner of your cooking-stove.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence took the paper in her hand, looked at
the indorsement, looked at Mrs. Carter. The color flushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>into her face; tears, that imprisonment and wrong had
failed to wring from her, came, drop by drop, into her hard
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, why this is the mortgage!” she said. “The old
mortgage, that was eating up everything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly. Put it in the stove, and never think of it
again. It is mine, and I give it to you for a nice little bonfire.
Eva, dear, come and kiss me. Ruthie, why what are
you crying for, child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Down by the invalid’s couch Mrs. Carter sank upon her
knees, folded her arms around the startled girl, and began
to sob like a great warm-hearted baby, as she was—God
bless her!</p>

<p class='c006'>After a little she lifted her face, all wet and smiling, like
a full-blown rose, with rain trembling on it, and got up,
ashamed of her own goodness, and the emotion that sprung
out of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see I always was such a goose—crying when I
ought to laugh, and hard as a rock when I ought to cry.
Don’t let anybody know that you ever saw me like this.
But I tell you, girls, it isn’t every day that one can get so
much joy out of a trumpery bracelet, and save half the
price too. You have no idea how much money that old
paper has saved for Carter. I’ll be bound he’s chuckling
over it yet.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE ADOPTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva, whose face had changed from red to white, with a
swift transition of feeling, came forward suddenly, and
threw her arms around Mrs. Carter’s neck.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“Oh, how good you are! How I love you! Can we do
anything—anything on earth to repay all this?” she cried,
in a warm outburst of gratitude. “It seems to me that
I could fall down and worship you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There! there! That’s all nonsense, my dear. Just
remember that there is only one thing you can do, and
having once refused, I can never ask you again after this,
not wanting to buy love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, don’t say that, Mrs. Carter. It was because they
could not spare me—because they were in such trouble, and
needed help so much. Even now——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop a minute, dear. Does your heart go with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes! yes!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you go with me now? That is, will you let me
arrange this with your mother. The people down yonder
don’t want your help. I do. My life in that grand mansion
is lonely. I haven’t been brought up to reading, and
music, and such things. I want some one to write my
notes, do my spelling, and sing to Carter—and am ready to
pay for it. If you are willing to work for men that sell
goods, why not work for me at double the price? I don’t
mean to keep you away from home; there needn’t be a day
that you can’t come here. Besides, I have an idea about
Ruthy. You shall learn to drive the pony-carriage, and
take her out every morning. I’ll have an elevator put up
in the house, and she shall just be lifted up to Herman’s
studio—in fact there’ll be no break up about it. Say now,
once for all, will you come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if you knew how I wish it; but poor Ruthy!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She don’t look so terribly troubled,” said Mrs. Carter,
glancing at the gentle girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall like the rides <i>so</i> much,” said Ruthy. “Then,
perhaps, I might see what the Park is like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you shall, with plenty of cushions, and a
gentle horse. There can be nothing like it. There now,
you see, Eva.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Eva went close to her sister, knelt down, and laying her
cheek against the pale, tremulous face, whispered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sister, darling, could <i>you</i> let me go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We should not be much apart,” answered Ruth. “And
she is so good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>While the girls were consulting together, Mrs. Carter
went into the kitchen, where she found Mrs. Laurence
pressing the mortgage down with the poker into a flaming
bed of coals. The scarlet light shone on her face, giving it
the glow of long-banished smiles. She closed the stove as
Mrs. Carter came up, beaming with good nature, and spoke
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You needn’t ask me; I have no right to keep her from
you. Eva has been a good girl, take her; but let her come
home sometimes for Ruthy’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After this there was a passionate clinging of arms, warm
kisses, and a tearful face, looking wistfully through the carriage
window, as Mrs. Carter drove away with her adopted
daughter, for the whole affair amounted to that, under the
guise of an agreement.</p>

<p class='c006'>In less than a week it was known throughout the fashionable
world that the wealthy Carters had adopted that beautiful
girl, Eva Laurence, and intended to make her an heiress.
It was also known that the whole Laurence family
had been benefited by the change—that a delicate, lovely
girl, who had been a great sufferer from childhood, had
developed such wonderful talent for painting, that Mr. Ross
had taken her for a pupil.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was all true. From that humble cottage Eva had
passed into a life so luxurious and pleasant, that it realized
all her ideas of paradise. No more work, no walking up
and down town in drifting snow or driving rain. Warmth,
beauty and kindness, surrounded her on every hand. Her
love of the beautiful was gratified to the full. It seemed to
her that there was hardly a thing on earth which was not
given to her wishes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Yes, one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But she would not think of that; Fate had forbidden her
to love; in giving her everything else, that great first boon
of womanhood had been withheld. But she had in exchange
that sweet, pure, fatherly affection, which seemed to
have been taken away forever when Laurence died. No
one could be more generally kind than Mr. Carter, but it was
on the artist Ross that her heart rested with more than
filial affection; his loving patience, his tender assiduity,
sometimes won tears of gratitude from the girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>Was this love? Yes, but oh how different to that which
lay buried deep in her heart for the man she could not
marry.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few weeks from this the season was at its full, and
the Carters plunged into all its gayeties with a zest and
brilliancy hitherto unknown to them. To own and introduce
a creature so lovely, and so exquisitely refined, into
fashionable life, was a crowning glory to the ambition which
had urged these new people into society. They accepted
invitations—they gave parties—they occupied the most
prominent box at the opera, and had the glory of knowing
that their protegée, in spite of her humble origin, in spite
of envy and persecution, was in fact the Reigning Belle of
society.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be false to say that Eva did not feel this change
in her life as a transition into something like fairy land.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXV.<br> <span class='large'>IN THE PARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The prettiest park phaeton you ever set eyes on, drove up
to the Laurence cottage; a pair of white ponies with snowy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>tails that took the wind like banners, stopped with the
docility of pet kittens before the gate. An afghan on
which living roses seemed to bloom, was thrust aside, and
out sprang a young lady, who ran up the walk and entered
the house without knocking.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ruthy, Ruthy dear, I have got them in training at last.
Do look out of the window and see what darlings they are.
Now for your first ride in the park.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth sat up on her couch, thrilled throughout her feeble
frame with unusual excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh Eva, are those the horses? am I to ride in that
pretty thing? but how—how can I get there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind about that; I feel strong enough to carry
you myself. The truth is, I—I never was so happy in my
life; to think, dear, that they should give me all the pleasure
of doing this, for everything is mine, Ruth. We can
use it just when we please, and you shall ride every pleasant
day of your life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And see how the country looks. Oh Eva, what a darling,
fairy god-mother you have been to us!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have I? Then you are glad I went away?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only half away, sister. Why you are with us a great
deal more now, than while slaving down in that store.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I am, darling, and it <i>is</i> delicious to belong to one’sself.
They love me too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I should think so,” answered Ruth, a little sadly.
“Who could help it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we must not be talking at this rate; the day is too
lovely. Where is mother? Oh, here she comes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the bright exuberance of her feelings, Eva threw
both arms around her mother’s neck and kissed her with
affectionate warmth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are Ruthy’s things, mother? she must be
dressed at once.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are lying on the bed, Eva; everything is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>order,” answered the old woman, fairly smiling all over her
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva ran into the bedroom and came out with a sacque of
fleecy, white cloth, and a hat on which some soft feather tips
clustered like snow. These she put on to sister Ruth with
her own hands, saying blithely as she tied the hat strings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yes, Eva had a little lamb,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Its fleece was white as snow;</div>
      <div class='line'>And every where that Eva went</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That lamb was sure to go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At which Ruth laughed like a pleased child, but said the
bonnet felt so strangely on her head, it would take her a
little while to get used to it. Then her curls had always
wandered about in such a lazy fashion, what could she do
with them?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, they’re all right,” cried Eva, bringing a little seven
by nine mirror that Ruth might look at her own sweet face,
framed in by the bonnet, which she did, blushing like a wild
rose at the sight of her own delicate beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh Eva, I hardly know myself!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you don’t. Come, mother, are you and I
strong enough to carry her out? I might have brought
one of the men, but somehow I could not bear to have them
touch her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The two women were about to lift Ruth between them,
for the length of the flower-garden was more than she
could hope to walk, when Mrs. Smith came through the gate
followed by her husband, who approached the house with
evident hesitation, which his wife was eagerly reproving.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come along, they don’t hold malice, I tell you, besides,
they know that you didn’t mean it,” she said. “No wonder
you are ashamed of yourself, but that scamp might
have imposed on Sampson—no, Solomon—hisself. So just
walk in, as if nothing was the matter, and never seem to
mind it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Smith did walk in, looking humble and confused, but his
reception was so frank and cordial that he found no difficulty
in offering to carry Ruth to the carriage, which had
been the object of his visit. So the girl was taken out triumphantly
in the powerful arms of their old neighbor, while
the other females followed smiling, chatting, and congratulating
each other, like a brood of robins, when the strongest
fledgling begins to fly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Smith shook up the cushions which formed a sort of
couch in the carriage, on which the gentle girl was placed
in a half recumbent position by Smith, while all the neighborhood
looked on from doors and windows, wondering what
would happen next to that Laurence family, and if they
had really made up with Smith, after that affair about the
robbery.</p>

<p class='c006'>There would be no doubt on that subject after that dainty
nest of a carriage drove away, for Eva shook hands with
Smith before she raised her whip from its socket, and Mrs.
Laurence stood talking with him in the most cordial manner
by the gate, full ten minutes after it drove off. One of
the nearest neighbors heard him say,</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can always depend on me to carry her in and out,
Mrs. Laurence. It is the least I can do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then all the curious people that had been anxious about
the matter, saw Mr. Smith and Mrs. Laurence shake hands
over the fence, and they knew that cordial relations had been
established between the cottage and the corner grocery.</p>

<p class='c006'>This pleasant thought perhaps served to deepen the exquisite
sense of enjoyment that pervaded the whole being
of that gentle invalid, as she found herself moving in the
open air for the first time almost in her life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The easy motion; for Eva kept her ponies down to a soft
unbroken trot; calmed her into a state of dreamy happiness.
At first she was a little frightened by the noise of
heavy wheels and the rush of life all around her; but Ruth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>had not won for herself such abiding faith in God’s mercy
without putting some trust in human strength. She wondered
at the cool dexterity with which Eva guided her pretty
equipage through the streets, and shuddered a little now
and then, as a carriage rushed by them, so near that it
seemed as if there must be a clash of wheels; but this
soon wore off, for, with a graceful sweep and a swifter trot
the ponies turned into the park, and Ruth found herself in
paradise.</p>

<p class='c006'>Trees just tinged with the first frost of autumn, the grass
soft and green as velvet, gleams of water here and there,
flowers scattered along the drive, or clustering in gorgeous
masses; above all a soft blue sky with snowy clouds heaped
upon it, drifted to and fro by a mild south wind. Can anyone
doubt that this was Heaven itself to that fair and gentle
girl who had never in her whole life looked upon a scene of
such beauty before; indeed had scarcely seen a tree that
was not covered with dust from a city street, or a growing
flower except the humble garden plants that bloomed around
her own home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Eva, Eva! this is too beautiful! drive slower!
drive slower! I cannot bear to see all these heavenly things
pass away,” she would murmur, catching her breath with
delight. “The water there; the water, let me look at it;
let me feel the moist sweet air on my face.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva would check her ponies and bend her smiling eyes
on the invalid with loving satisfaction whenever she made
a request of this kind; occasionally she would utter a little
gleeful laugh at some question that a child would not have
asked. Sometimes her eyes would fill with tears, as she
felt the touching pathos of all this joy springing out of her
sister’s utter isolation, which she in her health and beauty
had scarcely comprehended before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are those beautiful white creatures, Ruthy? Ah,
indeed! how should you know? They are swans, dear;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>there now, watch them as they clear the water with their
snow-white bosoms. See them arch their graceful necks
and sail off toward the other shore scarcely caring to make
way for the pretty boats that glide up and down with such
sleepy stillness. Beautiful, you say, yes, indeed it is beautiful.
I shall never get so used to it that every visit will
not give me new delight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth did not answer. Her heart was too full of new
feelings. She drew a deep breath and closed her eyes. It
all seemed like a dream that she wanted to impress on her
brain.</p>

<p class='c006'>That moment a landeau drove by in which was a lady
and gentleman. Mrs. Lambert and her step-son, Ivon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth opened her eyes suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the matter, what made you start so, Eva?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing,” answered Eva, gathering up her reins.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only you seem tired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, I am only happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert had seen Eva Laurence, and the sight sent
a swift thrill of pain through her bosom. She turned and
spoke to her son.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Young Lambert turned sharply to his mother; he also
had seen the two girls in their little phaeton, and the sight
brought back a keen remembrance of all that this woman’s
pride had made him suffer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you speak, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You saw that young lady, and bowed coldly. I am
sorry for that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sorry, why, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because circumstances are changed, now. I no longer
oppose your wish to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, and in what has the lady changed?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She has become the adopted child of a man who, at
least, holds a high position in commercial circles.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“And is, I am told, engaged to marry the person whom
that man intends to make his heir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ivon, I do not believe it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it were possible for me to doubt what is an admitted
fact, my own position is the same.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, have you ceased to care for her?” asked the
lady in a voice rendered sharp by intense anxiety.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man answered her with four of the most
mournful words that ever brought sadness to a human heart,</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is too late!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE INDIA SHAWL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Eva had no heart to enjoy her sister’s happiness after
that one glimpse of Ivon Lambert seated by the woman who
had so cruelly broken up the sweetest hope of her life. His
cold bow and averted eyes cut her to the soul, and she drove
slowly home with a chilled and disappointed feeling that
contrasted forcibly with the generous and unselfish pleasure
of the morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perfect happiness is always a hope of the future. With
all her success and triumphs Eva was haunted by this one
cause of discontent. Ivon Lambert had met her more than
once in her social triumphs since she had resided with Mrs.
Carter, but it was always with a degree of reserve that chilled
her to the heart and made success itself almost worthless.
Indeed, after a few months of admiration and excitement
which followed her footsteps at every turn, society began
to pall upon her. One party was so like another, there
was so little variety in the people she met, that the girl
sometimes felt a craving for the rest and quiet of her old
life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>At such times she would go back to the cottage, and strive
to sink gently down into the enjoyment which graced the
tranquil existence of her sister Ruth, but hers was a restlessness
of the soul, and for that there is little solace
either in gaiety or quiet. Hunger of the heart can only
be appeased by that which it craves.</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing seemed strange to Eva; from the time she left
the cottage, Mrs. Laurence had changed completely. There
was something like reserve, and even shyness in her manner
when they met. This Eva could not understand, but it
chilled her a little. With James and Ruth she was always
welcome, and almost adored. To them she had never changed;
all the pomp and wealth of her surroundings only made
her the more beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some months after Eva had settled down in her new home,
like a nightingale among the roses, she entered a little reception-room off the hall, and found Mrs. Carter in conversation
with a sharp-eyed, cringing little man, who seemed to
be urging some request with great persistence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been so long looking for the purchaser, madam.
First I trace it to one party, then to another, and at last to
that dealer who would not remember to oblige me. But I
found a way to reach him and made an arrangement. He
gave me the number of this house, and madam’s name. I
had great hopes that you would be willing to part with the
shawl for the price you gave, as the owner wants it so much.
I never, in all my experience, saw any one feel the loss of a
pledge so keenly. So, as madam has a good heart, I can
see that by her face, I am sure she will not drive a hard
bargain with the poor man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter seemed restless and somewhat annoyed at
this man’s eager pertinacity. At one of the principal
dealers in such expensive articles, she had purchased one of
those rare and most exquisite shawls, which are manufactured
expressly for eastern potentates. These rich shawls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>are difficult to obtain, and precious among ordinary importations,
as diamonds compared with meaner stones. She knew
that there was not another shawl to compare with this one
for sale in the city, and had happened to purchase it at a
bargain. Now this man, whom she did not know, but who
announced himself as a pawnbroker, who had once held the
shawl in pledge, and sold it among other forfeited articles,
was appealing to her, in a keen and pathetic way, to give
it up, for the moderate price she had paid, because its former
owner was driven almost frantic by the loss of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter, being a woman, was touched by this appeal;
but from the same feminine reason, found her love of a bargain,
and her ambition to possess something more rare and
beautiful than her neighbors, opposing the kind impulse
with peculiar force. When Eva entered the room, she felt a
sense of support, and was almost ready to leave the decision
to her, for she had already learned to depend on the
young girl in most matters of taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva, dear, run up to my dressing-room, and bring a
shawl you will find in my armoire. I want you to look at
it, and help me decide about parting with it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva ran up stairs, found the shawl, and came down with
it falling in rich folds across her arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that is it,” cried the pawnbroker, eagerly rubbing
his hands. “I should know the pattern among ten thousand.
To think now that I should have known its value so
little! It cuts me to the soul!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter had taken the shawl, and was busy opening
its marvelous folds, revealing the long slender palm leaves,
in which the best tints of a rainbow were wrought with the
toil and art seldom bestowed on the modern fabrics that
flood our market.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, it is so beautiful! I should hate to part with it,”
said Eva, who had learned to estimate a creation like that
in her life behind the counter. “You might search years
without finding one like it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“You hear?” said Mrs. Carter, looking irresolutely at
the anxious pawnbroker.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, madam, I hear; but if it is beautiful to a stranger,
how much more so to the person who owned it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter looked at Eva with distress in her eyes, and
hesitation in her manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can I do? It does seem hard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Eva could answer, the man broke in,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Besides, madam will remember, that I am a poor man,
and have spent much time in searching for that shawl,
which time is a dead loss, if I fail to bring it back to the
owner, who is ready to pay me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That does seem hard!” said the good woman, appealing
to Eva, who was so lost in admiration of the shawl, that
the man’s greedy eloquence half escaped her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The owner has been to my shop again and again, wild
to get it. At first he wanted to have it back for a little;
but now he will pay anything. The last time he said, ‘get
it, and I will not count the cost. It is a case of life and
death. I must have that shawl.’ Then I went to work in
earnest. This was an inducement for one who toils so hard
and gets so little. After all my pains, madam will not be
so cruel as to take a poor man’s time for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eva, I think he must have it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a moment. Let me call Mr. Ross. He will comprehend
the claim this man has better than is possible for
us. He is in the study; I will find him in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva ran up stairs, while the pawnbroker, half-baffled and
wholly anxious, stood eyeing the shawl with mercenary
craving, and Mrs. Carter felt like a victim.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXVII.<br> <span class='large'>THE PAWNBROKER GETS HIS PRICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Directly Mr. Ross came down, and followed Eva into
the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pawnbroker stepped back to the wall, and uttered an
exclamation full of trouble and surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What! The gentleman here!—here, in this very
house! I cannot understand!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross turned, his eyes kindled, and his cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here at last? You have found it then? The shawl!—the
shawl! Oh, sister, you have it! But how can you
tell if it is the same? I must be assured of that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Ross, what is the matter? Do you know this
man? What is my shawl to you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your shawl!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, brother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you got it of this man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It seems that it came from him!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it is the same! I will swear to it! Oh, sir! the
time I have taken to search it out is well worth all you
promised.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps. I do not know yet. Give me the shawl,
sister; in half an hour I will return.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross was white in the face. He took up the shawl, and
gazed upon it, until tears absolutely trembled in his eyes.
Then he folded the garment carefully, as one handles a
shroud, and went forth, carrying it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence was busy in her kitchen, absolutely
humming over an old-fashioned love-song, for the great load
of a hard life had been lifted from her shoulders, and
awkward gleams of cheerfulness were beginning to dawn in
upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>All at once a man entered the back door, and came toward
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Mr. Ross, is that you? I didn’t hear the bell,”
she exclaimed, smoothing down her apron.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did not ring, Mrs. Laurence; I wished to find you
alone. Look at this, and tell me if it is positively the shawl
that came around that child, and that you put in pledge?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Laurence wiped her moist hands on a towel, and unfolded
the shawl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course it’s the same shawl, wherever it came from.
There is no mistake about that. I can swear to the curl in
every one of these long leaves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is then absolutely the garment that came around the
child you adopted?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I am ready to swear to it, if that is what you
want.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; there is no need of that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again Ross folded up the shawl, and left the house, passing
swiftly through the yard, and looking at Ruth, who sat
at the window, without a consciousness of her presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter and Eva were still in the reception-room.
The pawnbroker had retreated to the hall, where he sat on
one of the carved chairs, crouching uneasily forward, and
holding a rusty hat clenched in his hand. His eyes were
full of hungry anxiety; for the reward which he had hoped
for seemed slipping from his grasp. Still he waited, in
abject patience, determined to press his claims to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c006'>In less than half an hour the man started, and listened
with the vigilance of a house-dog. A latch-key turned in
the street-door, and Mr. Ross came in. He stopped on seeing
the pawnbroker, and asked sharply what he waited for?
then checked himself, and muttered,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! I remember. You want the reward. How much
was it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man started up, and began to speak eagerly. But
Ross lifted his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“The amount?—name it. I ask nothing more; that
which I promised you shall have.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Without regard to the price paid by the lady?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Without regard to anything. I am not disposed to
cavil over a thing like this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The pawnbroker paused, calculated, and looked keenly at
his victim, sorely tempted to double the original sum promised
him. But there was something in the eyes fixed upon
him which checked the idea, and he named what had been
his most exorbitant demand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this single word, Ross went swiftly upstairs, and
came down again with a check in his hand. The man
started up, seized the paper, glanced over it, and hurried
from the house, with a greedy light in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross turned into the reception-room, stood a moment on
the threshold, pale, trembling, and with a look of wild
yearning in his eyes. Eva, came toward him, smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do tell us what makes you so anxious, Mr. Ross——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl broke off with a cry of dismay, for Ross had
flung his arms around her, and was straining her to his
heart with wild vehemence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My child! My darling! My own, own beautiful
child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man was raining kisses upon her forehead, which
was wet with his tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter started up, and with her two shaking hands
attempted to tear the man and girl apart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman! Herman! Are you crazy? And she under
this roof, under my care! Give her up, I say!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross still held the girl close; but lifted his head, and
looked his angry sister in the face. He could not speak,
though his tremulous lips moved, and his eyes were flooded.
The woman’s voice softened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman, what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“It means, my sister, that as God has been merciful, I
believe this girl to be my own child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man was trembling from head to foot. He put Eva’s
face back from his bosom, and looked tenderly down
upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you never felt this, my darling? Did your soul
never tell you the secret that has so long filled mine?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have no breath to answer,” faltered the girl. “Your
words strike me dumb! How can the things be that you
speak of?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot tell; yet I know. Wait a little while, and
you shall both be convinced that I am not out of my mind;
let the rest prove as it will.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>MISS SPICER RECEIVES HER DISMISSAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A newspaper was in Mrs. Lambert’s hand. In the
listlessness of a mind utterly prostrated, she had taken
little heed of passing events, and of the little drama which
had been enacted against the Laurence family, almost under
the sanction of her own name, was entirely ignorant.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was an old paper which had been wrapped about some
parcel at which the lady was looking. Just as she was
about to lay it down, her own name, with that of Miss
Spicer, astonished her into sudden interest. The article she
read was an account of that trial which had sent the Boyce
brothers to Sing Sing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert knew that Eva had been adopted by the
Carters, and that her success in the fashionable world was
something marvellous, but of the underhand machinations
that led to it, she had never dreamed till now.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>Ivon Lambert had informed himself of the main features
of this disgraceful transaction at the time, but never mentioned
them to his step-mother, who was suffering, and so
ill that no unpleasant thing was permitted to come near her.
She knew in a general way that the man Robert Mahone
had left her service; but under what circumstances, every
person admitted into her presence was interested in concealing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus it happened that this statement in the paper took
the proud woman completely by surprise, and aroused the
sensitive pride in her nature so completely, that Ellen Post,
when she answered the sharp pull of her lady’s bell, was
startled by the vivid fire that lighted up those sad features.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellen Post, is this thing true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert held the paper out in one hand, pointing
to the report with the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen caught one glimpse of the hateful sheet, recoiled a
little, then gave her head a toss, and said, with a degree of
careless contempt that did honor to her nerve:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that was Miss Spicer’s little job. My name was
dragged in promiscuous. That about me is all lies, from
beginning to end; but Miss Spicer and that Mahone was
awful thick for awhile. She was always giving him money,
being so malicious against that handsome Laurence girl,
that she was willing to plot with any one against her. I’m
pretty sure she <i>was</i> in the scrape, because she once offered
me anything I’d ask just to join in with them; but, of
course, I never had a word for her, but no. I want to marry
that Mahone! The idea! I hope, marm, you think better
of me than that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert was a woman of the world, whom airs,
such as her maid put on, were not likely to deceive. She
simply folded the paper, drew forth her portemonnaie, and
paid Ellen Post a month’s wages in advance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot give you a recommendation,” she said, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>quietly, “and probably shall never have occasion to mention
your name. Perhaps you had better put on your
things, and go at once. The express man will come for
your trunk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellen Post turned her half-scared, half-insolent face on
her mistress. It had turned to a dull grayish-white, and
her eyes gleamed with gathering malice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps, marm, you had better think twice. Some
girls are blind as to what is going on around them, and can
be sent off meek and broken-hearted; but I ain’t one of
that sort. Just take a second thought, marm. You’d better,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never take a second thought, Ellen. Go! I am
engaged!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The slender finger that pointed toward the door belonged
to a fragile, but firm little hand, which scarcely seemed
strong enough to support the diamonds that blazed upon it;
but a revolver could not have more effectually silenced the
impudent servant. Ellen walked backward, step by step,
until she almost fell against a footman, who stood in the
door with a card in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert took the card, giving no further heed to
the retreating maid, and read the name upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Spicer! Tell her to come up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a rustle of silk flounces, a clatter of high heels,
as Miss Spicer came up the stairs. There was also a strong
scent of the last fashionable perfume left floating in the
hall, as she entered her friend’s boudoir, closing the door
behind her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifteen minutes after this Ellen Post glided down the
back stairway, with an evil look on her face, and a satchel
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then all was still, and only a faint murmur of voices disturbed
the sumptuous quiet of that lady’s boudoir. Voices,
did I say? Only the quick, rattling sound of Miss Spicer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>tongue was heard; the firm, even tones of Mrs. Lambert
never penetrated beyond the room in which she sat. Once,
when the door was open, and Miss Spicer stood upon the
ermine mat, biting her lips, and beating her flounces with
the end of her cane parasol, the clear ringing tones of that
voice penetrated into the hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, Miss Spicer, I will take leave of you now; for this
is the last time that you will ever be admitted into a
house of which I am mistress.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Spicer turned upon the mat like a little fury.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, madam! I suppose it is just possible to live without
coming into your house! Heaven knows, it’s been dull
enough since that girl cut you out with Ross, the painter!
This is the gratitude one gets for paying off your debts.
I’m thankful for one thing; though! She’ll marry him,
and leave you to break your mean old heart; while Ivon
will hate you forever and ever for breaking up his little
matrimonial game. Good-by, Mrs. Lambert. If you can
stand it, I ought to, having nothing very dreadful to look
back upon, and plenty of youth, which you will never have
again!”</p>

<p class='c006'>As Miss Spicer was flying down stairs in her hot wrath,
Ivon Lambert came into the hall, and stood aside for her to
pass. She stopped suddenly, and held out her hand with a
hysterical laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There; let’s shake hands, and say good-by. Your
lovely mother has just turned me out of doors; but see if
I don’t pay her off! If that fellow, Ross, don’t marry your
old lady love, and I for one have no idea that he ever
thought of it, I’ll marry him myself, and ride over the old
woman rough-shod. With his genius and my money we
could do it—for people are beginning to talk about her
awfully, I can tell you; something about the conservatory,
and fainting dead at the artist’s feet. Ellen Post knows
all about it. She’s just been sent away, and won’t the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>story ring. Of course I shan’t help it forward. Oh, no!
she hasn’t insulted me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Ivon could even comprehend this rude speech, the
young lady had turned the latch and door-knob with a force
that tore her gloves, and hurried down the pavement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivon, who had intended to visit his mother, went to her
room, where he found her pacing up and down the carpet,
flushed with suppressed excitement, and with unusual fire
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My son!—my dear son! I am glad, very glad that
you are here. Something, no matter what, has disturbed
me. I have been hard and selfish with you; my own
wretchedness has made me cruel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your own wretchedness, mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there, Ivon! Do not question me; but generously
accept my atonement, without explanation. I have
been very, very unhappy of late; but I am not speaking of
myself. You are dear to me as any son could have been.
When I die, all that I have shall be yours, without restriction.
From this day out the world shall know you as my
heir. Another thing, once more I say to you, seek out that
girl and marry her, if you can. I will accept her with all
my heart. Carter has made her his heiress—be it so! I
make you my heir. Go, ask her to marry you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother! Mother! how can I? She has refused me
once,” cried the young man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that was after I had trodden on her pride, when
she thought herself worse than poor. Now you go to her
with my full consent. I will call upon her, and urge your
case, if that is needful. Go, my boy—go now. I shall not
be at rest till your fate is settled.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Astonished, bewildered, and like a man in a dream, Ivon
Lambert went to his own room. Was his step-mother in
her right mind? Had she placed him in a condition to
approach Eva once more, now that she was an heiress? If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>so, mercenary motives could not be imputed to him. Yes,
yes, there was yet a chance of such happiness as he had
given up in despair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXIX.<br> <span class='large'>THE TRUTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another ring brought a servant to the front door, where
a gentleman with a package in his hand, stood waiting.
The man reached out his hand for the parcel, but in its
place, received a card, with directions to carry it at once to
his mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no question about Mrs. Lambert’s being at
home; no seeming doubt that she might refuse herself; all
of which was strange; but the servant did not think of that
till long afterward, for obedience seemed natural to that
voice of quiet command.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My lady will see you in her own room—walk this way,”
said the man, returning promptly, after delivering his message.
He ushered the stranger up stairs with great deference,
and opened the door with a bow, altogether forgetting
the package which the man carried.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert was struggling to compose herself; but she
had been greatly excited, and every nerve in her frame
quivered. She tried to speak, but the effort only brought
tears into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross did not take the hand held out to him with such
timid hesitation; but laid his bundle on a chair, then turned
a sternly agitated face upon the trembling woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth, I have come to ask you a question.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will answer it, Herman! There is nothing you can
ask that I will not reply to. But first,—do not misunderstand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>me; I ask it for—for the sake of my step-son. Answer
the one question that I asked you.—Is that girl, I
mean Eva Laurence, anything to you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anything to me—and you ask this? Yes, everything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love her, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, better than my own soul.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—but you cannot marry her. It would be——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman’s lips turned deadly white, and what she
might have said died upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Marry her! Woman, I wonder the heart does not
sicken in your bosom at the thought.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does! it does! Then you never thought of it. I
had not wronged you so deeply that you meditated that
awful blow, that wicked, wicked crime.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never thought of it, Elizabeth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman clasped her hands, and a wild sob heaved her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still you loved her! Ah, me! it was only the impediment!
If I were dead, now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman held out her clasped hands, and her face was
wet with a rain of tears. For the first time, a look of
almost yearning tenderness filled the sad eyes bent upon
her, and a touch of compassion quivered in the man’s voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit down, Elizabeth. I have a few questions to ask,
and for once you and I must have truth between us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert dropped to the sofa, near which she stood,
and Ross drew his chair in front of it. The curtains hung
low, and the light fell dimly around them, so dimly that
they seemed like ghosts questioning each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth, when we first met, and I found you Lambert’s
widow, there was too much of passion and reproach in our
interview for a clear understanding of events, which seem
to me vague and unsatisfactory. Quiet yourself, now; be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>calm, if that is possible, and let us thoroughly understand
each other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman made a strong effort, and hushed her sobs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we married, I was a wild, passionate youth, penniless,
almost friendless; but I loved you, God only knows
how dearly!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And, oh heavens! how I loved you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Had I been older or wiser in this world’s wisdom, it
would have been an act of treachery when I won you to
that private marriage; but I was an enthusiast, possessed
of some genius, and more wild hopes. Perhaps in the arrogance
of these untried feelings, I held your father’s wealth
in too much scorn. Certain it is, I never craved it, never
wished for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that, Herman; yet it was this very wealth that
drove us apart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I asked you to go away, and share my fate——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I could not; remember how young I was. An only
child, loving my father, whose forgiveness you refused to ask—loving
you better than my own life, but afraid to follow
the hopeless path you were resolved to tread. Why did
you leave me then? Was I angry—was I unreasonable in
that struggle, so hard upon a young girl, pampered, as I had
been; did I say things which were altogether beyond forgiveness?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I left you in anger, bitter and keen as it was, my
great love conquered it, before I was half across the ocean,”
said Ross. “But what came after? My letters were unanswered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never received them. Some one, my father, I think,
kept them back. Oh, Herman! you will never know how I
waited, how I longed for one line!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth, give me your hands. On your life, on your
honor—as you hope for salvation, did you never hear from
me, never see a line of my writing after I left you?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“As God shall be merciful to me, I never did!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman felt the two strong hands that clasped hers
shake like reeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you thought me dead?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did! I did!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, and not till then you married this other man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Herman! It was only my hand and wealth that I
gave him. When love perished in my heart I had only
ambition left.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then all love for me had perished?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Herman! There never has been a time when the
very memory of our love has not been dearer to me than the
adoration of any living man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The hands which Ross still clasped were tightened painfully.
For half a moment he was silent. When he did
speak, it was almost in a whisper, and his voice was hoarse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth! What have you done with our child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert wrenched her hands from the passionate
grip fastened on them, and stood up in wild agony.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our child! Oh, Father of heaven! is there no mercy
for me? Have I not suffered enough?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman had no strength to stand. As grass goes
down beneath the scythe, her limbs gave way, and her face
fell forward on the cushions of the sofa.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross bent over her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leave me! You have torn the vulture from my heart—let
it bleed to death; for, in a little while, I, like my
child, will be beyond human reach! God knows all that I
have done, and all I have suffered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross knelt down by the woman, and laid his hand on her
shoulder. Her suffering overpowered all sense of wrong in
his bosom. The thing which she had done seemed less
hideous when her grief filled the room, as with the wail of a
mother bereft.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“Our child is not dead, Elizabeth! I come to tell you
so!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman lifted her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not dead!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let that awful thought haunt you no longer. The
child is alive. Not an hour ago I held her in my arms.
God spared her life, and you, wretched woman, a great
crime.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman shuddered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God help me! God forgive me! I was sorely tempted.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXX.<br> <span class='large'>OUR CHILD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A moment after these words left her lips, Mrs. Lambert
started up. The idea that her child lived had seized upon
her with force; for the first time, her face, still colorless,
was radiant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is alive!—your child and mine! Alive! and you
have found her for me! A child given to my bosom—a sin
lifted from my soul! Man! Angel! Husband! Let me
fall down and worship you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“First thank God that an awful sin has been lifted from
your conscience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do! I do! But the child—where is she? Who is
she? Will you let me see her—touch her—bless her? Oh,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have seen her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where? When?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At my sister’s house. She is known as Eva Laurence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more the woman sunk to the sofa mute and pallid.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Laurence was the policeman you spoke with just before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>you turned down to the river. He followed you. He saw
you leave the infant upon the rock, where you had carried it;
watched as you crept away through the woods; reluctantly,
he thought, but still you went, leaving the child to its fate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no! I did not. In less than an hour, oh! much
less, for I was hardly out of the shadow of the trees, I went
back, resolved to bear everything, suffer everything, rather
than part with it—but the rock was bare; the moonlight
lay upon it, cold and white. I searched eagerly, but my
child was gone. I sought for it everywhere—in the hollows,
among the ferns, in the water. All night I wandered
up and down on the shore—but my child was gone. I had
left it wrapped up, warm and asleep. No human being
was nigh. The rock sloped downward; it had rolled into
the water! I thought this—I have always thought it. Oh
do not look on me with those searching eyes, Herman. I
was mad, wild—driven to desperation—a child-mother fleeing
that night from shame and a father’s wrath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My father had been absent almost a year. He had
placed me in a school in New England, which I left, as if
for home, but hid myself in New York. When my baby
was but a few weeks old I learned that my father was coming
home. If I was not there, he would search for me at
the school, and learn how long I had been absent. You
had left me; I had not heard from you. Consider, I was
so young—all alone, a wife, a mother—but without a husband.
All this drove me mad. No doubt I was absolutely
insane.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Mrs. Lambert’s passionate excitement began to
exhaust itself. She lifted a hand to her forehead and went
on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I remember, in a vague way, wandering off in search
of a river, with the child in my arms, longing to hide myself
and it in the water. If I had any purpose, it was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>go beyond the reach of my father’s wrath, and take my baby
with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the woman, seized with infinite self-pity, began to
moan and weep.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I remember nothing, except that the black water frightened
me. I think it was not for myself, but the child. I
was wondering if it could be kept dry and warm when I was
asleep down there. Then I grew afraid for myself, and fled
into the woods to escape the dull, heavy lapping of the
water, which both lured and repulsed me. I have told you.
It was gone when I came back, gone forever and ever; I
had come back, clear in my mind, resolved with half insane
courage, to take it in my arms, and tell my father the
whole truth. But it was gone. It was gone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>When the woman ceased speaking, Ross knelt by her
side, and heavier sobs than hers filled the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My poor girl! My wronged young wife! God forgive
me the rashness of my youth—the injustice of my manhood!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She lifted her face, radiant under the storm of tears that
had passed over it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You pity me! There is no longer suspicion in your
eyes. Sometimes you will perhaps think that I was not all
to blame, that in wresting the child from my bosom, God
punished me enough. Ah, you did not know how I loved
it, how I pined for it! How gladly I would have taken it
in my arms and followed you to the ends of the earth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Elizabeth, Elizabeth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no theatrical outbreak; but those two hearts,
that had been separated one-third of a lifetime, seemed
breaking with a great fullness of joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, my Elizabeth! There is something in life for us
yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She took his hand between hers, and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Oh, Herman! I never, never expected to be so happy
again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But there is greater joy than this in store.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know! I know! Our child! That beautiful girl. I
was so jealous of her, Herman. Only this very day did I
consent that Ivon——Do you know that Ivon loves her
dearly? Well, only an hour or two ago I promised to
make him my heir if he could persuade her to marry him.
That was half because I pitied his disappointment, and
half because people said that you loved her,” said the poor
woman with a laugh, that reminded Ross of her girlhood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And so I did from the very first. Now I understand
why. She is very like you. That was what struck me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was I ever so beautiful, Herman?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross bent down, and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you have not told me how you found all this out.
We must have good proof; a doubt would kill me now.
Ah, me! how strange this happiness seems.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did not come to you, Elizabeth, without proof, though
the very face of our child is enough. Come here, and see
if you remember this!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross took the shawl from a table, where it had been laid
and shook out its folds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert uttered an astonished cry and stood gazing
on it, shrinking back a little as one retreats from the touch
of a shroud.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was my mother’s,” she said at last. “I remember
wrapping the child in it, praying her to pity me if angels
in Heaven could feel pity. Oh I remember it so well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When our Eva—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our Eva,” whispered Mrs. Lambert, clasping her hands
so softly that he went on, without heeding the pathetic interruption.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When our Eva was found on the bank of the river, this
shawl was wrapped about her. There was some coral too.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>“Pink coral from Naples; I remember it! But what
did they do with my child? How was she made the lovely
creature we find her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Laurence was a gentleman in his habits, and educated
the girl well. He left me a letter, which you shall read.
There can be no doubt that she is our child; Mrs. Laurence
admits it, and no girl ever did her parents more honor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And this policeman brought her up?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As his own child, with his own child; and no two
young ladies could possess more refinement.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I could look down upon them with scorn.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You did not know them. But now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I have but one wish; for—for you have forgiven
me, Herman?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert held out both her hands; the passionate
tenderness of girlhood swept over her face, as it fell upon
his bosom, drawn there by the strong arms that she knew
would enfold her evermore.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now let me see my child, and die of happiness,” she
said, lifting her radiant face from his bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In less than an hour Eva shall be with you,” said Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“An hour! how long it will seem, Herman.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The happy can afford to wait,” he answered. “Now I
will go and tell them everything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Must this be?” asked Mrs. Lambert, with a touch of
shrinking pride.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five persons <i>must</i> know the truth, Elizabeth. Beyond
them, our unhappy past need never be known.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And those five?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My sister, her husband, Ruth Laurence, Ivon, and our
child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Be it so. We can trust them; for all have been kinder
to her than her own mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beyond them we will have no explanations. There must
be a public wedding, and that will silence all questions.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>A soft, rosy color came into the woman’s face, and for a
moment her eyes sunk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the young people are married, Eva will be your
daughter, of course. Chance has arranged everything for
us,” Ross went on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But she has refused Ivon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you she loves him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am sure that he loves her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And where love is, what power can keep two souls
apart! I tell you, Elizabeth, it will be a double wedding,
and after that a double household.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go—go and bring Eva!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LXXI.<br> <span class='large'>A DOUBLE WEDDING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Carter and Eva still remained in the reception-room.
The passionate words of Herman Ross had filled
them with amazement if not alarm. They could not
believe the thing he had so wildly stated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it should be now,” said Mrs. Carter, “if you really
are his daughter and my niece, I shall just believe a special
Providence sent you under this roof. Only to think how I
took to you from the very first.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot understand, it all seems so unreal. Not
Ruthy’s sister—not related to little James. It is impossible!”
answered Eva, in sad perplexity. “Still there was
something from the first that made me turn to him. Love,
yet not love; such tenderness as brings tears into one’s eyes.
Is that the way a child feels towards its father?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, as I never had a father since I was six years old,”
answered Mrs. Carter, “perhaps you’d better ask some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>else, but that is a good deal like my own feelings toward
brother Herman; for I just worship him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When will he come back? I am so restless,” said Eva
going to the window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So am I. It’s of no use to attempt anything; my heart
jumps into my mouth at every noise. What if it should
prove true? Come and kiss me, child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva threw her arms around the good woman’s neck, but
she was so nervously restless that her very kisses were tremulous.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am so anxious,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is coming! that is his step!”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Herman Ross, walking up to the door with the
light tread of a boy. His face was radiant when he entered
the room. He advanced to Eva and took her tenderly in
his arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true, my child; my own, own child!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva looked at him wonderingly; the whole thing seemed
so marvellous, that she could not at once return his caress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how? tell me more!” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross sat down on the couch, and drew Eva to his side.
Mrs. Carter moved her chair closer.</p>

<p class='c006'>He told them all, with the brief passionate eloquence
which perfect joy inspires. Before half his narrative was
over, Eva had crept into his arms, and Mrs. Carter was
sobbing like a child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And this lady is my own mother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ross leaned forward and kissed Eva’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Eva, your unhappy, bereaved mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor lady!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is waiting for you now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva arose agitated and trembling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am ready; take me to my mother. Oh! how
strangely the word seems; but my mother that was! how
can I give her up!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“There is nothing to give up, Eva; but everything to
accept.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You—you have always been my father!” cried the
girl with a sudden outburst of affection, “from the first
moment I have loved you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you will love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dearly, papa.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl gave a little joyous laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what a dear, dear word, papa, papa!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But there is one dearer yet, Eva.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, by-and-by I shall get used to it; but will she let
me, I hardly dare.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My sweet child, how little you know her. She is counting
every moment till you come. I left her crying like a
child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor lady, poor mamma.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl’s face brightened all over, as the word fell from
her lips. She looked shyly at Ross, and whispered it again
and again as if to familiarize herself with the sweet sound.
He smiled and passed his hand over her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come now, your mother is waiting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eva left the room and then Ross saw that his sister was
crying bitterly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the matter! Why are you distressed?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! I loved her so! She was like my own child.
Now—now that other woman will take her from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That she never will! Elizabeth understands too well
all that you have done for her child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“After all,” said the kind woman, brightening up like
a child, “she <i>is</i> my niece, and that is something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Besides, you forget that Elizabeth is your sister,” said
Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Lambert my sister—mine! How strange it seems—such
a beautiful, lovely lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Before Eva came down stairs, Mrs. Carter had begun to
console herself; after all, it was something to have a niece
like Eva, and a sister-in-law who had been for years a
leader in society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Lambert was indeed waiting with passionate impatience
for a sight of her child. The flood of her own
happiness fairly transfigured the woman. Her pride was
all swept away; the calm force of her character had disappeared
with the secret that she had guarded so well.
She walked the room; she flung herself on the couch and
wept the sweetest tears that had ever visited her eyes.
She went to the window and looked longingly out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Would they never come? surely, surely more than an
hour had passed.</p>

<p class='c006'>A dozen times she walked to the window; a dozen times
she seated herself, resolved to wait in patience. When
she heard footsteps coming, a sweet faintness crept over her,
and reaching forth her arms, she saw everything in a mist.
Then the kisses rained on her face, seemed coming through
a dream; but above it all came that one sweet word that
she had so longed for when that girl was a helpless babe,
lost to her as she thought, forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother, mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Two weddings astonished society within a month of that
day. Ross the artist, and Mrs. Lambert were married on
the same morning with Ivon Lambert and Eva; of course
the fashionable world was thrown into a state of excitement;
but Mrs. Lambert had controlled public opinion too long
for any fear of losing social power under any circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Carter was very lonely and desolate in her grandeur
for some weeks, but it was not long before Ruth Laurence
was almost as much at the house and as welcome there as
Eva had been. The park carriage was by no means given
up, though it frequently happened that young James handled
the white ponies in place of sister Eva, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Mrs. Laurence was seen by his side, sitting prim, upright
and vigilant, as if she fancied that some one might suspect
her of putting on airs, because of the great prosperity that
had settled on her family.</p>

<p class='c006'>It often came to pass in the after time, that Mrs. Carter
took her tea dinner in Mrs. Smith’s upper rooms without
much household scandal; but when her carriage began to
stop at the corner grocery on its way to or from the cottage,
the cup of Mr. Battles’ indignation was full, and he loftily
gave warning.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all, that diamond bracelet came from Ball &#38; Black’s
in full splendor, and lying on its purple satin cushions,
was among the most conspicuous of Eva Lambert’s bridal
presents.</p>

<p class='c014'>Desire to direct the close attention of all lovers of good novel reading to the
works and authors contained in their new catalogue, just issued. A strict scrutiny is
solicited, because the books enumerated in it are among the most popular now
in existence. In supplying your wants and taste in the reading line, it is of the first
importance that you should give special attention to what is popularly designated entertaining
reading matter. No library is either attractive or complete without a collection
of novels and romances. The experience of many years has demonstrated
that light reading is essential to even the most studious men and women, furnishing
the mind with healthful recreation; while to the young, and to those that have not
cultivated a taste for solid works of science, it forms one of the best possible training
schools, gradually establishing, in a pleasant manner, that habit of concentration of
thought absolutely necessary to read understandingly the more ponderous works,
which treat of political economy, the sciences, and of the arts.</p>

<p class='c006'>We publish and sell at very low rates, full and varied editions of the works of
all the famous American and Foreign Novelists, whose writings are very entertaining,
specially adapted for all readers. The most of them are bound in strong cloth
binding, and also in paper covers. Examination is asked for our editions of the
writings of <span class='sc'>Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth</span>, whose romances are always in
demand; <span class='sc'>Mrs. Ann S. Stephens</span>, the well-known favorite; <span class='sc'>Mrs. Henry Wood</span>,

<p class='c006'>This new edition of Charles Dickens’ Writings is in twenty-two volumes,
and for beauty and cheapness far surpasses any ever before issued. It is
called “Petersons’ New American Edition,” and is printed on fine paper,
from large, clear type, leaded, with original illustrations as selected by
Mr. Dickens and designed by Phiz, Cruikshank, Browne, Maclise and other
artists, and bound very gorgeously in red vellum, black and gold, with the
cover filled with the author’s principal characters, which he has made so
world-famous. There in one corner is the immortal Pickwick, in another
the well-known Micawber, the learned Capt. Cuttle, poor little Oliver Twist,
the misguided Grandfather, the mean, hypocritical Pecksniff, the mercenary
Squeers, Boots, The Beadle, etc., and all of this for the small sum of
$1.50 a volume, or a complete set in 22 volumes, each set put up in a neat
box, for $33.00, making a very handsome and unique edition.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
